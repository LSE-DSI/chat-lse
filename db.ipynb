Introduction  \\nThis document sets out the procedures you will need to follow when you sit your in-person exams. This \\ndocument includes procedures for hand written exams and e-Exams . Please read it carefully – it tells you \\nwhat to expect and what to do when the unexpected happens.  \\nAll candidates must  read this docu ment in full and must follow the exam room instructions  as directed by \\nthe i nvigilator(s) and question paper . Failure to do so may  result in an allegation of misconduct and could \\nlead to disciplinary action . Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable defence.  \\nIf you have not already done so, please check  LSE for You  for your personal exam timetable. Personal \\ntimetables will be available from the dates indicated on the Exam Timetable webpage . If you  believe there is \\nan error or find you are not registered for a course you are taking, please c ontact the Exams Team via the SSC \\nenquiry form . \\nThese procedures apply only to in-person exams run by the School. If you are due to submit an online \\nassessment  or coursework,  you should contact the  academic d epartment responsible for that assessment for \\nsubmission rul es and instructions. If you are taking a course with another institution, you should receive \\nsimilar information directly from that institution.  \\n2. Candidate number  \\nYour candidate number is a unique five-digit  number t hat we use to ensure your work  is marked anonymously.  \\nPlease note that : \\n- it is not the same as your student ID number  \\n- if you have taken exams at the School previously, it will not be the same as your c andidate number \\nfrom earlier y ears \\nYou should write your candidate number on your exam answer b ooklet(s) and not your name or student ID \\nnumber.  \\nYou can find your candidate number in LSE for You . \\n3. Exam timetables and locations  \\n3.1. School exam timetable  \\nWhile we make every effort to avoid altering the  exam  timetable after publication, changes are occasionally \\nnecessary. Any amendments will be clearly indicated on the online timetable.  \\n3.2. Personal exam timetable  \\nYour personal exam timetable  on LSE For You  gives details of your room and seat number for each of your \\nexams. It also shows your candidate nu mber (see section 2). \\nYou must  bring a print -out of your personal timetable  and your student ID card  to each exam.  You should \\nplace it with your LSE  ID card at the top right of your desk, so that the invigilator can easily check it.  You must \\nnot write or print on your personal  timetable  before or during the exam . Any notes on the timetable may be \\nconsidered as exam misconduct  (see section 9.3). \\nOnce your  personal timetable is published, please contact Exams via the SSC enquiry form  immediately if you \\nthink any of the information is incorrect.  \\n3.3. Exam locations  Page 3   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n Most e xams will take place on campus, but we use a variety of buildings .  It is common for candidates taking \\nthe same exam to be seated in diffe rent rooms or even building s, so check your timetable carefully.  It is \\npossible August exams may take place off campus so please ensure you read all notifications carefully.  \\n3.4. Seating  \\nAs well as publishing your personal timetable on LSE for You , we post details of rooms and seat numbers by \\ncandidate number each morning in the Student Services Centre.  \\nThere are a number of reasons why you may not be allocated a seat in any o f the main rooms:  \\n• You were entered for the exam after the timetable  was published  \\n• You have Central  Exam Adjustments  (CEAs)  (see section 5 ) \\n• You have short-term Central  Exam  Adjustments  (see section 6) \\nIf any of the above applies to you, your exam room and seat number will be posted online here , in advance of  \\nyour exam , and on separate lists in the Student Services  Centre  (we use pink paper to make it easy to find).  \\n4. Permitted materials and equipment  \\nPlease note that if you do not abide by the instructions and specifications in this section, the School may \\nconsider your behav iour as cheating (see section 9.3). \\n4.1. Personal items, phones and other electronic devices  \\nYou must not use mobile  phone s, smart wat ches,  stop watches,  e-readers, tablets or other electronic devices \\nduring an exam.  If sitting an e -Exam you will be permitted to bring in your own device on which to write your \\nexam , as well as a power bank for your device, but th ese devices  must adhere to  the specifications set out in \\nsection 8 below which contains specific guidance for e -Exams. Calculators may be permitted (see section \\n4.5). Phones and smart watches must be turned off completely, not  set to silent or do not disturb, and  placed \\nunder your desk. Any other personal items such as religious icons or mementos  must be placed under your \\ndesk. Other electronic items must be left in your bag. The invigilator will give instructions about where  in the \\nexam room  you should leave pers onal belongings.  You must not bring a large amount of luggage with you as \\nstorage space is limited in exam rooms.  All bags and other personal items must be brought into the exam \\nroom rather than left in the corridor. Items left unattended outside of the ex am room will be removed by the \\nSchool Security Team.  \\nYou must ensure that any alarms or reminders which may create a disturbance are deactivated. If your \\nactions or any of your equipment causes a disturbance, the School may take disciplinary action.  \\nYou ar e strongly advised not to bring any electronic devices or other valuables to the exam room. If you \\nchoose to do so, this is at your own risk. The School does not take responsibility for loss or damage.  \\n4.2. Dictionaries  \\nYou are not permitted to use a dictionary under any circumstances, including to overcome any deficiency in \\nyour command of the English language.  \\n4.3. Personal items  \\nYou are responsible for bringing your own pens, pencils, rulers etc. to the exam. These are not provided fo r \\nyou and spares are not available.  You are not permitted to bring ear plugs to exams.  You may request a pa ir of \\near plugs from the invigilators by raising your hand.  \\nIf you use a pencil case or similar, it must be transparent to allow invigilators to see the contents without \\ndisturbing you or other candidates. If an invigilator cannot see the contents clearly, they are entitled to check.  \\nYou may not bring any paper into the exam, including Post -It notes or new tabs to mark permitted materials (if \\nyou wish to use tabs to mark permitted materials, you must apply these before entering the exam room).   \\nYou may bring an unlabelled, re -sealable, clear plastic  drinking bottle into your exam. Food is not allowed in \\nexams unless you have a CEA specifically allowing it (see section 5). Medication is not allowed in an exam Page 4   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n unless you have a CEA specifically allowing it. Please note that if your CEA permits taking medication into the \\nexam room, the medication must be stored in a  clear, label -free container . \\n \\n4.4. Academic materials  \\nDetails about other permitted materials, such as notes, books, tables, statutes etc. are available from the \\nrelevant academic department . If you are unsure about what you may or may not take into an exam, you \\nshould check w ith the relevant department.   \\nIf your exam is ‘open book’ you are permitted to bring in any written/printed material into the exam including \\nwritten notes and textbooks. Your textbooks may be marked with written notes. You are not permitted to have \\nany ele ctronic devices at all.  If sitting an e -Exam, please be aware that you will not be able to view notes on \\nyour device. R efer to section 8 for more information.  \\nIf your exam is not ‘open book’ but you are permitted to bring  specific texts into the exam, they  must not \\ncontain annotations  (notes or comments)  and you may not write on them during the exam. Highlighting, \\nunderlining or unmarked tabs are acceptable; however,  you must apply any tabs before entering the exam \\nroom . Invigilators will check texts during the course of the exam.  Where an invigilator finds prohibited \\nmaterials, such as annotations, the permitted material will be removed from the exam room. The invigi lator \\nmay file a misconduct report against you which could lead to formal action being taken under the School’s \\nRegulations on Assessment Offences . \\n4.5. Calculators  \\nYou may only use a calculator in an exam if the front of the question paper states that a calculator is \\npermitted.  If you  find that you have a calculator in an exam where it is not permitted, you must alert an \\ninvigilator immediately to hand it in.  \\nIf you are allowed to use a calculator, it must  be from the Casio fx -83 or fx -85 range . All other types of \\ncalculator are not p ermitted  unless expressly stated on the front of the question paper . If you try to use an \\nalternative model it will be removed by invigilators. You will not be provided with a replacement,  and you may \\nface an allegation of academic misconduct.  If your calculator is confiscated during the exam, this is not a \\nvalid reason to submit exceptional circumstances. If you are sitting an e -Exam you will not be able to use the \\ncalculator within your own device.  \\nYou are responsible for ensuring that your calculator  is in working order. We do not provide replacement \\ncalculators during the exam. You must not share calculators with other candidates within the exam room. \\nThere must be nothing written or scratched on to your calculator and there must be no labels or stic kers on \\nyour calculator.  \\nUnless specified by the academic department  which teaches the course , you may not access information \\nstored in the memory of your calculator or use any other software during your exam.  You will be responsible \\nfor clearing any store d memory from your calculator , or if applicable, setting your calculator to test mode. If \\nyour calculator is found to have items in  the memory, this may be considered academic misconduct.  You \\nmust be able to demonstrate that your calculator is in test mode  and has a clear memory if requested by an \\ninvigilator. If you are unable to confirm that your calculator is in test mode and has a clear memory, it may be \\nconfiscated.  \\nYou must  write the make and model of your calculator clearly on your answer book let. \\n5. Central  Exam Adjustments ( CEAs)  \\nYou may be eligible for Central  Exam Adjustments  (CEAs) if you have a d ocumented medical, physical or \\nmental health condition and/or a Specific Learning Difficulty such as dyslexia or dyspraxia . If you have not \\nalready done so, you should contact the Disability and Mental Health  Service ( DMH S) at disability -\\nwellbeing@lse.ac.uk  or on 020 7955 7 767 for more advice.  Please note that there are deadlines for applying \\nfor CEAs. Late applications cannot be considered.  Please see section 6  for what to do if you have a short -term \\nillness or condition which affects you during the exam period.  Page 5   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n If you have approved  CEAs, you will be notified before the start of the exam period. The Exams Team will send \\nthis information to your LSE email account.  \\nIf you have CEAs, you will not sit your exam in the main room(s) with the other candidates. Details of where \\nyou will sit your exam(s) will be available online, in advance of your exam, here  and on separate lists in  the \\nStudent Services  Centre  (we use pink paper to make it easy to find).  \\nIf your CEAs are agreed after your personal timetable is published, you may have already been allocated a \\nseat in one of the main rooms, rather than a CEA room. If you take up your seat in the main room, rather than \\nthe room indicated online or on the pink list s in the Student Services Centre , your CEAs will not be applied.  \\nCEAs are intended to remove inequality at the point you take the exam,  so Exam Boards  are not made aware \\nof approved CEAs for any individual candidate. If you feel that your CEAs were insufficien t, e.g. as the result of \\nan acute episode of a chronic condition, you should inform the Exam Board by submitting proof of Exceptional \\nCircumstances  (see Section 9.6). \\n6. Short -Term Central  Exam Adjustments  (ST CEAs)  \\nIf you experience an unexpected medical problem which you think may warrant particular exam arrangements, \\nyou must submit your a pplication for short -term CEAs a minimum of one week (7 days) prior to the exam you \\nwish to have adjustments in place for.  Appli cations should be submitted via the short -term CEA form . \\n \\nYou should also think carefully about whether you should be attempting the exam(s) . The School operates a \\nfit to sit policy and therefore you should think carefully before attempting the exam. You can seek further \\nguidance from your home department or the Student Advice and Engagement team . If you wish to obtain an \\nextension  or deferral , please refer to section 9.5 . \\nPlease note that short -term Central  Exam Adjustments will not be put in place for long term or chronic \\nconditions or any contagious illness (such as  Covid -19, chicken pox or mumps). If you contract a contagious \\ncondition you should inform  the SSC and remain in isolation as far as possible. All of the necessary processes \\ncan be completed via the enquiry form/email , and under no circumstances should you come to the School. If \\nthe School is made aware that you have a contagious condition you will not be allowed to sit your exam.   \\nExam Boards  are not made aware of a pproved S T CEAs for any individual candidate . If you feel that the \\nagreed S T CEAs were insufficient, you should submit proof of Exceptional Circumstances  (see Section 9.6). \\n7. Sitting the exam  \\nBy entering the exam room you are declaring yourself fit to sit the exam .  If you have experienced disruption \\nto your studies prior to the exam (from personal difficulties  e.g. bereavement  or illness  etc.) you must think \\ncarefully about whether you should attempt the exam or whethe r you should discuss deferring the exam  with \\nyour academic department . If you go on to request a  deferral this will be considered by the Student Services \\nCentre . If you feel unable to attempt an exam or set of exams  you should carefully consider if you should \\ndefer. You must submit your deferral request no later than 24 hours before the start time of  the exam. \\nRequests received less than  24 hours before  an exam cannot be considered. See section 9.5 below.  \\nShould you decide to attempt your exam(s) , despite your circumstances or because it was too late to request \\nto defer , you should submit Exceptional Circumstances and appropriate corroborating evidence. Though you \\nshould note  the Exam Board are entitled to take the fact you had declared yourself fit to sit into account . If you \\npresent yourself to an exam, you are expected to make a reasonable attempt at the assessment by answering \\nthe questions in the paper. If you fail to do so, your attempt may be treated as an absence and this could have \\nsignificant consequences for your results and eligibility for an award. You can not request to defer  with less \\nthan 24 hours before the start of the exam or submission deadline. . \\n7.1   Entering the exam room  \\nYou should arrive at the School in good time for each exam and be at the room at least 30 minutes  before the \\nscheduled start. Pleas e ensure you have checked travel arrangements and allow sufficient time for your \\njourney  and time to get to the exam room . The invigilator will tell you when you may enter the room and where \\nto leave any bags, coats or other personal belongings (see Sectio n 4).  Page 6   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n 7.2 Clothing  \\nThere is no dress code for exams but you should not wear any clothing which would prevent an invigilator \\nfrom being able to identify you from your student ID card or which may conceal headphones. You may be \\nasked to remove any headwear whic h is not worn for religious purposes.  \\nIf you wear a facial covering for religious or cultural reasons, a member of staff (of the same sex as you) may \\nask you to accompany them to a private room to check your identity  after the exam . They may also check tha t \\nyou are not bringing in any equipment or materials, other than those permitted (see Section 4).  \\nYou may wear a face mask for health reasons in the exam room if you wish. If you do so, invigilators reserve \\nthe right to ask you to briefly remove your face mask to check your identity when taking the attendance \\nregister. Invigilators may also request that you show them you do not have any unauthor ised material on your \\nperson. This might require you to show them the contents of your pockets, sleeves or baggy clothing and the \\ninside of your face mask. Please also refer to section 7.7. regarding toilet breaks.  \\n7.3 Conduct during the exam  \\nYou are expected to conduct yourself honestly and respectfully during the exam. This means following all \\ninvigilator instructions, being aware of your surroundings and being aware of how your behaviour may impact \\non other  students in the exam room. Failure to comply with i nstructions could lead to formal action being \\ntaken under the School’s Regulations on Assessment Offences  or the School’s Discipli nary procedures .  \\n7.4 Question papers  \\nBefore the exam starts, you must check  that the question pa per on your desk is correct for you . You should \\nalso check  that you have an answer booklet and that you have been given any/all permitted materials which \\nthe School provides.  If sitting an e -Exam, please refer to section 8 for more information.  \\nIf there are different papers for different years of study, you will sit the paper that corresponds to the last year \\nin which you received teaching for that course. Check the question paper to make sure the year on the paper \\ncorresponds to the year in which you received the teaching. If you are concerned you do not have the  correct \\npaper, you must raise this with an invigilator as soon as possible. It may not be possible to rectify this if we \\nare notified once the exam is underway or you have begun to complete the exam. The syllabus year will be \\nshown on your personal timeta ble. If the year shown on your timetable is incorrect,  please contact the Exams \\nTeam as soon as possible  via the SSC enquiry form . We print papers specifically fo r resit/deferred candidates \\non coloured paper to make them easy to identify.  \\nRead the instructions on the front of the paper carefully.  \\nMake sure you take time to read through the whole paper at least once before you start writing.  \\nCheck that you know how many questions there are and how many you need to answer.  \\nReading time may be permitted if indicated on your exam paper. This is additio nal time to the duration of the \\nexam. This time can only be used for reading the exam paper , unless otherwise stated. You may not take \\nnotes or write in your answer booklet , unless the exam paper explicitly states you may make notes during  \\nreading time. You may not use a calculator in reading time , unless the exam paper explicitly states that you \\nmay. Invigilators will inform you of the start and finish of reading time and when you may begin writing. If you \\nbegin writing before permitted, this may be consid ered to be academic misconduct.  \\n7.5 Answer booklets  \\nFor handwritten only exams, you will be provided with one answer booklet per exam. For e -Exams where you \\ndecide to hand write your answers you will need to raise your hand to request an answer booklet. If si tting an \\ne-Exam, please refer to section 8 for more information. In all cases, once you have an answer booklet, the \\nfollowing applies:  \\nIf you need additional answer booklets , you should raise your hand and an invigilator will bring you a \\nsupplementary book let. At the end of the exam, please tie  together all booklets you have been given securely \\nwith  the stationery  provided, including any rough work . It is your responsibility to ensure all answer booklets \\nused are securely tied together.  \\nYour answers must be written in English unless the paper specifies otherwise.  Page 7   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n You must write legibly, preferably in dark blue or black ink. You may use pencil if you prefer but please bear in \\nmind that pencil can be faint to read and can smudge , and this may affect the ability of the marker to mark \\nyour answers . Be careful not to lose marks because your answers are  difficult to read.   \\nYou will be asked to enter your ca ndidate number and details of the exam on the front of your answer booklet.  \\nIf you have used any supplementary booklets, you must ensure this is clearly noted on the front of the main \\nanswer booklet. You should also write your candidate number clearly on any supplementary booklets. Please \\ndo not write your name or your student ID number on your booklet(s).  \\nIf a note  paper section has been included with your question paper , you may use this for any rough work or \\npreparatory notes . This section is specifically for rough work and will not be submitted or marked.  Do \\nnot use this section to write any part of your answer that you wish to be marked.  Anyny rough work or \\npreparatory notes  made  in your answer booklet(s)  must  be submitted. If you do not want a marker to mark \\nsomething you have written  in an answer booklet , whether that is part of an answer or rough work, clearly \\ncross it out in your booklet.  Some exam papers state that answers should be written on the question paper, in \\nwhich c ase you may do so, and this will be submitted and marked , but you must also submit your answer \\nbooklet, even if you have not written anything in it. You may not write anywhere else – this includes writing on \\nbody parts. If you are found with writing anywhe re other than where it is explicitly permitted, this may result in \\nan allegation of misconduct.  \\nYou must stop writing as soon as the invigilator announces t end of the exam . This applies even if you have \\nnot finished an answer , sentence  or word – you must stop writing immediately. This also applies if you just \\nneed to complete the details on the front of your answer booklet (s). If you do still need to put your details on \\nthe front of the answer booklet(s), you should raise your hand and wait for an invigilator. Please note that if \\nyou do not abide by this instruction, the School may consider your behaviour as academic misconduct  (see \\nsection 9.3). You will not be able to make any changes to your answer booklet(s) after you have left the e xam \\nroom; this includes requesting that changes are made to the details you completed on the front of your \\nanswer booklet(s).  \\nYou must not remove any  materials supplied by the School from the exam room . It is now strictly prohibited \\nto remove the question  paper from the exam room. Please see section 7.7 for further guidance.   \\n7.6 Exam question queries  \\nPlease note that exams are intentionally difficult. The cachet of LSE degrees, in the eyes of other universities \\nand employers, is at least in part based on the School\\'s rigorous academic standards. You should not, \\ntherefore, be surprised if your exams feel more difficult than the previous years\\' papers or practice questions \\nyou may have attempted.  \\nExams may contain questions that surprise you and that are unlike past questions. This is intentional: the \\nexaminers want to test that you have understood the material well enough to cope with new types of \\nproblems. Though challenging and difficult, the exam will also be fair.  \\nDuring the exam, if you have a concern about the content of the question paper  e.g., you think something is \\nincorrect or does not make sense , you should alert the invigilator. They will contact the Exams Team  who will \\nthen check your query with the examiner. Invigilators are not able to help with interpreting questions or \\nassisting with your understanding of a particular word or phrase. In the rare event that an exam paper \\ncontains a substantive error the Exams Team  will work with the relevant academic department to resolve the \\nissue during the exam  if possible . However, y ou will not normally be granted any additional exam time.  \\nIf you still have concerns after the exam, you must  raise the matter in writing with the  Student  Regulations \\nTeam  via the SSC enquiry form within seven  days of the exam in question.  \\nIn the very rare event that an exam paper contains a substantive error which m ay have affected all candidates, \\na member of staff from the SSC will liaise with the Chair of the Sub -Board of Examiners and all candidates will \\nbe informed of any action taken. Therefore, you only need to submit an Exceptional Circumstances Form  if \\nyou feel there were specific circumstances that affected you as an individual that th e Sub -Board would not be \\nable to take into account without specific information from you.  \\n7.7 Leaving the exam room  \\nYou are not allowed to leave the room during the first 30 minutes or last 30 minutes of the exam . Page 8   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n Outside these times, if you wish to leave the  room you must raise your hand and seek permission from  the \\ninvigilator.  \\nYou will be escorted by an invigilator on any toilet breaks . You must stay with the invigilator at all times  when \\nout of the exam room. The invigilator will direct you as to which toilets and which cubicle to use and you must \\nfollow their instructions. If you leave the exam room for a toilet break, you must leave all stationery, exam \\nmaterials and personal belon gings at your desk. You will be asked to show the invigilator that you are not \\ncarrying any prohibited materials; this will mean emptying your pockets and/or rolling up sleeves or any loose \\nclothing prior to entering the toilet. If you opt to wear a mask d uring the exam, the invigilator will also ask you \\nto show them the inside of your mask. You will not be given additional time if you take any toilet breaks.  \\nPlease ensure that you take all your personal belongings with you when you leave at the end of the exam.  You \\nmight be surprised how many candidates leave their phones under the desk or forget their bag!  \\nTaking photographs in exam rooms or buildings is prohibited before, during and after  exam s. \\nPlease leave the exam room and the surrounding area as quietly as possible  to avoid disturbing fellow \\ncandidates as other exams may still be continuing. If you are taking an exam in Clement House,  you must exit \\nthe building via the back staircase, as directed by the invigilators.  \\nNew for 2023/24 - You are no l onger permitted to take any question paper away with you or remove it from an \\nexam room after an exam. The question paper should be placed within your answer booklet at the end of an \\nexam. This is also true of any exam materials that you are provided with e.g., answer booklets and permitted \\nmaterials.   \\nRemoval of any question papers or exam materials from an exam room may result in an allegation of \\nacademic misconduct.  \\n7.8 Emergency evacuation  and pausing an exam  \\nIn the event of an emergency evacuation, for exa mple a fire alarm sounds, you must follow the invigilators’ \\ninstructions at all times. Safety is the priority, so you must follow all instructions to ensure an efficient \\nevacuation. If evacuation is required, the invigilators will instruct you to leave the  building safely, efficiently \\nand in silence and they will guide you to the assembly point. You must not stop to collect belongings, and you \\nmust leave all exam materials in the exam room.  \\nYou will remain under exam conditions unless otherwise notified . This means that, amongst other things, you \\nare forbidden from using mobile or other devices, consulting materials or communicating with other \\ncandidates. Failure to comply with these procedures and verbal instructions may result in disciplinary a nd/or \\nacademic misconduct action being taken against you and  may affect the likelihood of the exam being \\nresumed.    \\nYou must not attempt to re -enter the building until the invigilator,  or a member of the Exams Team directs you \\nto do so. On re -entering the  exam room, please follow the instructions of the invigilators . \\nWhenever possible, exams will restart following an emergency evacuation.  The invigilators will give you full \\ninstructions if this happens. If the exam is re -started you must not start writing  until you are told you can do \\nso.  \\nAll answer booklets will be marked in accordance with usual School procedures. However, examiners will be \\nnotified of the disruption.  \\nThe SSC will ensure that Exam Boards are notified of the circumstances so that they ca n be taken into \\naccount when ratifying marks, progression and classification.  You only need to submit an Exception al \\nCircumstances Form  if you feel there were specific circumstances that affected you as an individual that the \\nSub-Board would not be able to take into account without specific information from you.  \\nIf it is not possib le to restart the exam, it may be necessary to reschedule an alternative sitting but the School \\nwill do what it can to avoid this where it is academically appropriate.  \\n7.9 Pausing an exam  \\nIn very rare circumstances the Exams Team  may decide that an exam should be temporarily paused  meaning \\nall students must stop their exam but remain seated within the exam room . In the event of a paused exam,  Page 9   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n you must follow the invigilators ’ instructions at all times. You will not lose any writin g time as a result of a \\npaused exam,  and you remain under exam conditions unless notified otherwise.  \\n8 e-Exams  \\ne-Exams, like handwritten exams, take place in -person on campus and under invigilated exam conditions. e-\\nExam answers are typed and submitted using  your own personal device via pre -installed e -exam software \\ncalled Digiexam.  e-Exams are different from online assessments . For online assessments  there is no \\nrequirement to be on -campus and there is no invigilation . \\nFor more information, please see the e-Exams webpage . \\nIn addition to the specific details contained in this section, all other current exam procedures must be \\nfollowed.  \\n8.1 Sitting the exam  \\nYou should arrive at the exam room 30 minutes before the start of the exam. The invigilators will inform you \\nwhen you are permitted to enter the exam room.  \\nYou will be provided with a hard -copy exam question paper, hard -copy e -Exam guidance sheet and any \\napplicable supplementary materials (e.g. graph paper) on your exam desk.  \\nAnswer booklets will not be placed on desks for e -Exams. If you need an answer booklet before or during the \\nexam, raise your hand to request one from an invi gilator. Any answer booklets you have been given must be \\nsubmitted at the end of the exam. If you have only used the answer booklet for rough working/notes you \\nshould cross that work out if you do not wish it to be marked but you are still required to subm it these answer \\nbooklets. Please see section 7.5 for more information.  \\nYour device must be closed or locked with no programmes or applications running when you enter the exam \\nroom. Approximately ten minutes before the scheduled start of the exam, you will be instructed to open your \\ndevice, log into Digiexam and open your exam . You should not be accessing notes/other applications on your \\ndevice when at your desk in an exam room. Invigilators will provide instructions on how to do this and e -Exam \\nSupport Assistants (ESAs) will provide assistance  if necessary. Once the exam is open on Digiexam, your \\ndevice will be locked down  and you will be unable to access any o ther applications and only the answer \\nscreen will appear. If calculators are permitted in the exam you are sitting you will not be able to use the \\ncalculator within your device. You will need to bring in a separate calculator in accordance with section 4.5.  \\nYou must not start typing until the invigilator tells you to do so. Typing before instructed may constitute \\nacademic misconduct.  \\nAt th e start time of the exam, the invigilator will instruct you to turn over your exam question papers and start \\nthe exam. Digiexam will not give you the start or end time of the exam, invigilators will notify you of when to \\nstart and stop typing. The exam que stions will not appear in Digiexam. Use the text box on screen to indicate \\nwhich questions you are answering and provide your full answers, just as you would in a hard -copy answer \\nbooklet. Spell check within Digiexam will be activated during all e -Exams.  However, the spell check feature \\nmay not recognise names or technical words which may show as incorrect even if they are spelt correctly.  \\nPlease see the e-Exam webpage  for further information.  \\nIf you need any assistance at any point, raise your hand. Please see section  8.5 for more information. If you \\nneed to leave the room  you must be accompanied by an invigilator e.g. for a  toilet break or rest break where \\napplicable , within Digiexam you can click on “Exam Information” to take you back to the front screen of your \\nexam. This will prevent anyone being able to see your answers. Once you have returned from your break, you \\ncan re turn to the text box and continue your answer  by clicking on “Go to first question” . If you accidentally \\nhand in your exam or close your device , please raise your hand to ask for assistance.  \\nYou must stop typing your answers when instructed by the invigil ator. You will be instructed to hand in your \\nexam by clicking the  “Hand in”  button in the top right -hand corner. Typing after you have been instructed to \\nstop may constitute academic misconduct.  \\nOnce you have handed in your answers, you will not be able t o revisit them. Other applications will be able to \\nrun on your device again as normal - however your device must be closed or locked and remain so until after \\nyou have left the exam room  otherwise you may be in breach of the School’s academic misconduct ru les. Page 10   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n  \\n8.2 Use of keyboard shortcuts  \\nNot all keyboard shortcuts are supported in Digiexam. Instead of Cut + Paste, we recommend using Copy + \\nPaste and then deleting the duplicated text. We recommend using the native undo/redo buttons provided in \\nthe text editor  instead of undo/redo keyboard shortcuts.  \\n \\n8.3 Permitted materials and equipment  \\nDownloading the Digiexam app is an essential step before entering an LSE exam room. You will not be given \\nadditional time or support to set up the app in an exam room.  \\nYour device  must have a battery capable of lasting the length of your exam - usually two to three hours, plus \\ntime to set up beforehand and submit your work at the end of the exam. Please test your device to check that \\nthis is the case.  \\nIt is your responsibility to make sure your device  is in full working order and brought to the exam room with as \\nclose to maximum battery charge as possible. If not, or if you do not bring a device, you will be instructed by e -\\nExam Support Assistants (ESAs ) in the exam room to complete your exam on a paper answer booklet.  \\nYour device must be a laptop or a tablet device with an integrated keyboard. Tablet devices which do not have \\nan integrated keyboard are not suitable. You must only bring one device into the exam room i.e. you cannot \\nhave two laptops/tablets on your exam desk. Your device must have a USB or USB -C port . In the unlikely \\nevent of WiFi connectivity issues, the e -Exam Support Assistants will use a USB device to enable you to \\nsubmit your answers . If you bring a device which does not have a USB or USB -C port and need your answer file \\nto be recovered, this will not be possible. Not bringing a suitable device is not a valid reason to apply for \\nExceptional Circumstances.  \\nYou are permitted to bring on e portable power pack  with a suitable charging cable  into the exam room to \\nprovide additional charge to your device. It must be placed under your desk when not in use. You will not be \\nable to use a charging point (plug socket) in the exam room.  Other techn ology -related items are not permitted \\nin exam rooms, this includes external mice, external keyboards and laptop stands. If you have a documented \\nphysical, medical or mental health condition, and/or specific learning difficulty and therefore need additional  \\nequipment, please see section 8.4 for more details. You must not  have any notes or markings on any of your \\npermitted equipment, e.g the outside of your device or power pack. Invigilators have the right to check any \\nmarkings or stickers attached to your dev ice or power pack . You must not have anything plugged into your \\ndevice (i.e. a USB stick), except for a power pack (optional). Instances of the above may be considered \\nacademic misconduct.  \\nEduroam is the recommended Wifi network, make sure that you have th is as a saved network before entering \\nthe exam room.  \\nYou must bring your mobile phone, adequately charged, with you into the exam room  in the unlikely event that \\nthe Digiexam software  needs you to use Multi -Factor Authentication (MFA)  to log in . Phones mus t be turned \\noff completely, not set to silent or do not disturb, and placed under your desk. If you need to use your phone \\nfor MFA,  you must  raise your hand and an invigilator must supervise you. You must ask for permission before \\npicking up and using your  phone for any reason. Picking up your phone without asking for permission may \\nconstitute academic misconduct.  \\nIf applicable to your exam, you must  bring an external calculator  as you will not be able to access any \\ncalculator from within your device.  More information about permitted calculator models can be found in \\nsection 4.5.  \\nLaptop/tablet bags/cases must be placed with your other belongings, not under your chair/desk.  \\nYou must bring pens, pencils, rulers etc. with you, in case you are required to switch  to paper. These are not \\nprovided for you and spares are not available.  \\n \\n8.4 Central Exam Adjustments (CEAs) (e -Exams)  Page 11   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n If you currently have CEAs, your adjustments such as extra writing time or rest breaks still apply.  \\nIf your CEAs include use of a PC, your e xam will take place in a PC room and you will have the option to use \\nDigiexam on your own device or Microsoft Word on an LSE PC (which is not connected to the network). Like \\nall students, you also have the option to handwrite your exam.  \\nIf your CEAs includ e a Letter of Notification (LoN), the department will be informed of this so they can take it \\ninto account when marking your e -Exams.  \\nIf you need additional equipment (such as a specific keyboard or mouse) due to having a documented \\nmedical, physical or mental health condition and/or a Specific Learning Difficulty, you must  ensure these are \\nformally included as part of your adjustments , please contact Student Wellbeing Service ( SWS). \\nIf you currently have CEAs that you believe may need to be updated or you need to apply for CEAs, p lease \\ncontact t SWS for guidance and support.  \\n \\n8.5 Support during the exam  (e-Exams)  \\nThere will be support available in the exam  room from dedicated e -Exam Support Assistants (ESAs) to \\ntroubleshoot issues with logging in, accessing your exam, or submitting your  answers. Technical support, \\nbeyond the Digiexam system, will not be provided in exam rooms. It is strongly recommended that you test \\nDigiexam on your device before entering an exam room. Contact the Professional Services Team responsible \\nfor the course fo r more information  on practice opportunities . \\nIf you experience issues connecting to the Wifi network (Eduroam) before the start of the exam or when trying \\nto submit  your work, raise your hand for assistance.  \\nDuring an exam, your work will automatically sa ve every 10 seconds to both the Digiexam server and locally to \\nyour device. In the unlikely case that your device crashes or freezes, the exam can easily be restored without \\nthe risk of losing any of your work.  \\nIf you are unable to login and/or open the ex am on Digiexam, even with  (5 minutes of) ESA assistance, by the \\nstart of the exam you will need to request an answer booklet and hand write your exam. In the unlikely event \\nthat you experience unresolvable technical issues during the exam, ESAs will instru ct you to continue your \\nexam on a paper answer booklet. If this happens, you will be advised to write \"CONTINUED FROM DIGIEXAM \\nFILE\" at the top of the answer booklet. The ESA will log that you have moved to a paper answer booklet to \\nensure that both parts of your answers will be marked . \\nSpare l aptops and power packs (without cables) may  be provided in limited numbers  for technical difficulties \\nonly , but their availability cannot  be guaranteed.  \\nIf you arrive late to an exam room, you will not be given extra time to account for time taken to login to \\nDigiexam.  \\n \\n8.6 Handwriting in e -Exam enabled exams  \\nWhile we strongly encourage that students use Digiexam where available, you can choose to handwrite. Y ou \\ndo not need to inform the Student Services Centre or your Department ahead of your exam.  You must ensure \\nyou write clearly. Please see section 9.2.  \\n \\n9 When things go wrong  \\n9.1 Late arrival  \\n \\nIf you arrive late but within the first 30 minutes of the exam start time you may proceed to your designated \\nexam room. Please ensure you do not disturb other candidates upon entering the room. You will not be given \\nany additional time to complete the exam . If you arrive more than 30 minutes late you will not be permitted to Page 12   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n enter the exam room. If you arrive more than 30 minutes late, you will not be allowed to enter the exam room , \\nand will be recorded as Zero Absent for the exam. In such instances  you shou ld submit an Exceptional \\nCircumstances Form  (see Section 9.6) and any appropriat e evidence to explain why you were late so that the \\nExam Board can consider if there are any good reasons to discount the attempt . \\n  \\nIt is your responsibility to arrive in good time for your exam ( we recommend at least  30 minutes prior to the \\nstart time of the exam). You should allow sufficient time for your journey and time to get to the exam room .  \\n9.2 Illegible answers  \\nYou must ensure you write clearly so that the markers can concentrate on your answers, rather than the \\nquality of your handwriting. This includes smudged pencil or ink which is too similar in colour to the answer \\nbooklet. The examiners will use their academic judgement to determine whether or not they can understand \\nyour answers. You will not be given any f urther opportunity to clarify your answers and therefore you may lose \\nmarks if all or parts of your answer booklet are indecipherable. This could have a significant impact on your \\nability to progress, graduate or on your overall classification.  \\n9.3 Cheatin g \\nThe School takes exam offences extremely seriously and wil l investigate all allegations. If an allegation \\nagainst you is substantiated, it may lead to your expulsion. You should read the Regulations on Assessment \\nOffences  to ensure you avoid behaviour which could lead  to an allegation of cheating. This document draws \\nyour attention to some of the ways in which you could potentia lly be thought to be cheating. However, this is \\nby no means comprehensive.   \\nFurther, i n order to uphold the academic integrity of assessments and awards, the School reserves the right to \\ninterview you about your work after submission.  Any interview  will take place after internal marking has been \\ncompleted to ensure that they do not impact upon the mark given for the assessment.   \\nBeing selected for interview  is nothing to worry about and provide s an opportunity for the department to \\nunderstand the me thods you used for answering your assessment.  Interviews  will be based on the content of \\nthe assessment, and if selected you may be asked to provide a rationale for how you answered particular \\nquestions, the methods you used, how you assessed evidence etc . You will be given the opportunity to review \\nyour original assessment submission  as well as any Turnitin Report where applicable  when you are invited to \\ninterview.  The purpose of the interview is to check that the understanding of the topic aligns with y our \\nperformance in the assessment.  Examiners cannot use the interview in itself to change individual marks.  \\nNotes from the interview might be used as part of an assessment misconduct allegation where the \\ndepartment feel such action is necessary. However,  if an allegation is made against you, you will be provided \\nwith the opportunity to formally respond  and submit supporting evidence  during the assessment misconduct \\nprocess.  \\n9.4 Illness/unexpected events on the day  of the exam  \\nIf you are likely to miss an exam, you must contact the SSC as soon as possible  via the SSC enquiry form . \\nIf you are  absent from an exam and you were unable to sub mit a deferral request  in good time (see section \\n9.5 below ) because of illness/injury, or other serious , unforeseen  circumstances, you must submit an \\nExceptional Circumstances Form  with supporting documents  that verify your circumstances (see Section \\n9.6). \\nIf you are ill on the day of an exam, you are strongly advised to contact your doctor. You may also wish to \\ncontact the SSC for advice . \\nIf, before you leave your home  you become aware you have a contagious condition (e.g.  chicken pox, Covid -\\n19, measles, viral gastroenteritis)  you should stay at home and remain in isolation as far as possible. You \\nshould seek any necessary support from your local health authority. You should also inform the SSC as soon \\nas possible by enquir y form/ email, and under no circumstances should you come to the School.  \\nIf the School is made aware that you have a ny contagious condition you will not be allowed to sit your exam \\nand will be requested to leave the campus  immediately .  Page 13   Exam Procedures for Candidates 2023 \\n   \\n \\n If you are taken il l during an exam, you must inform the invigilator immediately so that any necessary action \\ncan be taken to help you and to ensure that the details are recorded. Please be aware, however, that additional \\nexam time will not be granted . If you are able/choose  to continue with the exam, you  will be required to finish \\nthe exam at the original scheduled completion time.  \\nFor all courses that you are registered for as part of your degree programme, y ou must attempt every element \\nof assessment to be eligible for an award. You will automatically be re -entered to take assessments in any \\ndeferred  or failed cours es, for which you are eligible  and have attempts remaining .  \\n9.5 Deferrals  \\nBy submitting an assessment or sitting an exam you are declaring yourself fit to do  so. Therefore, you should \\nnot attempt an assessment if have concerns about your capacity to perform to the best of your ability . Rather, \\nyou should consider submitting a deferral request. You must request to defer an assessment no later than 24 \\nhours befo re either the start time of the exam or submission deadline. Requests received after this deadline \\ncannot be  considered.  \\nPlease note that a  deferral is not a right.  Permission to defer will only be given where you have provided a \\ncompleted  demonstrat ing your inability to complete an assessment and appropriate supporting evidence.  \\nYou must ensure the evidence you submit is relevant, proximate to an assessment you wish to defer and that \\nit satisfies the School\\'s  Standards of Evidence Policy . You will receive formal confirmation about whether or \\nnot your deferral request has been appr oved at least two working days from the day after you submit your \\nrequest.  \\nThe deferral procedure has changed starting from the 2023/24 academic year. All deferral requests will now \\nbe considered by the SSC Student Regulations Team and not by your academic department. Please see the \\nDeferral webpage  for further support and guidance.  \\n9.6 Exceptional Circumstances  (ECs)  \\nIf you are absent from an exam  without having deferred  or feel that your performance in an exam has bee n \\nsignificantly and negatively affected as a result of significant and unforeseen circumstances, you may submit \\nproof of exceptional circumstances  and appropriate supporting evidence  to the SSC within  the published EC \\ndeadline.  The deadlines can be found here  and there are different deadlines depending on  the exam period.  \\nExceptional Circumstances will be considered carefully by the Sub -Board of Examiners. A Sub -Board may \\nrecommend a suspension of regulations (such as discounting a failed attempt, permitting an additional \\nattempt or raising an award classification) but only where the ex ceptional circumstances are unforeseen, out \\nof your control, proximate to the exam(s) in question  and if corroborated by appropriate  evidence.  \\nDisruption to your studies prior to taking your exams may be valid grounds to submit ECs, but this will be \\nassess ed on a case -by-case basis and your own individual circumstances will be considered separate from \\nothers. A Sub -Board can only consider factual information. It is important to consider this when submitting \\nECs and when providing evidence of your circumstan ces. \\nYou must submit supporting evidence with all EC submissions and all evidence must comply with the School’s \\nStandards of Evidence P olicy  and be in English.
