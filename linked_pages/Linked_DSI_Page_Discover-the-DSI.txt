Text: Browser does not support script. Baroness Minouche Shafik   We live in a world where we have more data than at any point in human history. It is pivotal that we use the computing power available to us to inform new research, new thinking, and new tools that can answer the most important questions that the world is facing. By bringing together LSE’s expertise and knowledge from across the School, the DSI will shape the global data science debate and put the focus on creating social impact.    It is increasingly vital to be able to analyse data and use it to answer the big political, societal, and economic questions. This makes the Institute integral to realising the ambitions at the heart of LSE 2030 as the School   hosting a range of events. These events include research workshops, public lectures, industry collaborations, and careers seminars. The DSI will also lead LSE in the implementation of innovative ways of working through the establishment of a cloud computing lab and data visualisation studio.
