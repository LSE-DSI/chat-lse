As stated in our governing documents, all applicants for this role must be approved by our Appointments Committee. Therefore, you must submit an application for this role as well as nominating yourself in the election portal. See the full role description and information on the application process at:https://www.lsesu.com/voice/elections/trustee/Ready to #LeadLSE?Apply now   FAQsWhat’s involved in running a campaign?The campaigning period is your opportunity to get yourselves known by students you don’t normally cross paths with. The best way to do so is by making yourself as memorable as possible and let students know what is unique about you and your ideas - it’s a great time to talk to students about why they cast a vote for you.And don't worry, you'll have lots of support from us at the SU! We have lots of info and guidance in our Candidate Information Pack, as well as our Online Support Hub and candidate training session. Most importantly, we're always on hand for a chat if you have any questions - just drop us a message at su.representation@lse.ac.uk I’m new to LSE, can I still run?Yes! Elections are a great way to get to know people you wouldn’t normally meet! LSESU will always encourage anyone to stand for the roles available, especially those new to our community.What positions can I run for?You can see the available roles on our SU website here: https://www.lsesu.com/voice/elections/Can I run for multiple positions?Yes, but we would encourage you to consider how this may impact your campaign’s effectiveness. It is easier to campaign for one position so that you can focus your message to your peers.You also cannot hold some positions at the same time - so for instance you could run for both Women’s Officer and LGBT+ Officer, but if you won your election for both of these roles, you couldn’t hold both of these positions at the same time as they are both members of the Executive Committee. This is the case if you are running for: two Part-Time Officer positions, two Sabbatical Officer positions, a Part-Time Officer role and a Sabbatical Officer role, or the student trustee role and a Sabbatical Officer role. You also cannot hold any other elected position if you are a member of Democracy Committee. Send us an email if you have any questions about this and we can talk it through: su.representation@lse.ac.ukCan I stand for election as a postgraduate student?Yes! All LSE students can run in elections, and we strongly encourage postgraduate students to run for SU positions.How can students vote?Between 9am Wednesday 22nd March and 4pm Friday 24th March you can vote online here at any time, or at one of our polling stations between 10am-4pm.Candidates and campaigners must maintain a reasonable distance (around 2 metres) from anyone who is casting their vote. You cannot, under any circumstances, stand over a student or talk to them while they are voting – even if they ask you for help. If they are struggling to vote, take them to an SU polling station or ask them to email us. You cannot provide your device for them to vote on, they must vote on their own device or go to the Students’ Union polling stations to vote.How do I report candidates who are breaking election campaigning rules?You can send an email to the Returning Officer at su.returningofficer@lse.ac.uk with details of the violation and evidence before the close of voting. You can view the election and campaigning rules here.You will submit your campaign expenditures and receipts to the SU. See an example below:ItemCost attachedHome printed/designed t-shirts£2 per shirtIf you already own materials that you’d like to use for your campaign and are unsure about the cost of them, you can request a judgement by emailing the Returning Officer at su.returningofficer@lse.ac.uk.

As 20th November draws closer, the excitement is heightening! The bets are being placed, the sports analysts are at work, and everybody has drawn up their own world cup brackets. Who will win? Who will lose? It's anybody’s guess!However, as questions of victory and loss fill every fan's mind, we feel there are other burgeoning questions that need answering. As a student’s union for one of the most diverse student bodies in the UK, we simply cannot turn a blind eye to some glaring ethical issues that have paved the way to make this world cup come to life. Ethical Concerns7 new stadiums were built to host the 64 matches of the world cup. However, the infrastructure in Qatar has been built largely using a  migrant labour workforce. There have been numerous allegations of workers’ rights abuse throughout. From passports being taken away until targets have been met to deaths of workers through improper construction regulations, there have been a lot of human rights red flags reported. Thus far, there have been 299 allegations of worker-rights abuse, 24700 potential workers’ whose lives have been ill-impacted by their work for FIFA, and an estimated 60% delay in wages to the workers. The Qatar world cup seems to owe a huge debt to its migrant workforce and we question if this debt can ever be truly repaid. Aside from its inhumane treatment of migrant workers, akin to modern slavery, Qatar has also been a hotbed of anti-LGBT+ sentiments with laws that criminalise homosexuality and homosexual activities. Penalties range from fines to imprisonment and in some cases, even execution. The conflicting statements from Qatari officials on whether public displays of LGBTQ+ support by fans and companies will be accepted and whether it is safe for LGBTQ+ football fans to visit Qatar for the matches make it quite clear to us that inclusivity is not a priority for the authorities of this world cup. At the same time, we wonder, can we celebrate with a country that ranks 142nd out of 152 countries in the world for women’s rights? With fundamental rights being restricted and their actions being governed by the men in their lives, women do not enjoy much autonomy here. Why We’re Still CelebratingThis world cup has drawn up so many discussions and questions. At LSE, we don’t intend to swipe them under the rug. We want to discuss and debate these issues. And, at the core of it, we want to remember that the world cup has always been an event that brings people together. World over, it is an event of unity and cheer. People join as one community, hoping for the victory of their team. We want this essence of community to be the focus of LSE’s celebrations.The slogan for this world cup is ‘Expect Amazing!’. However, at LSE, we expect more. We expect inquiry. We expect accountability. We will be celebrating the 2022 World Cup, but we will be doing it our way. With unique activities surrounding the screenings of the matches, our celebrations will be inclusive and hopefully open your eyes to the rich and diverse cultures that thrive in the participating countries. What are your thoughts?Is there a particular aspect of the World Cup you would like us to discuss? Is there a way of celebrating you want to introduce to us? We’d love to know! Drop an email to su.info@lse.ac.uk! Let us know how we can do better.

Postgraduate students will have different priorities than Undergraduates, Part-Time Study student concerns will differ from Graduate Teaching Assistants'. The ASC is there to ensure all these different student experiences are given a voice, by advising and feeding into the plans of LSESU senior leaders.All ASC members will receive a £300 honorarium as thankyou for your work representing students.As an Academic Sub-Committee member you would:Produce a termly report on the student experience of your representative student groupAdvise the Sabbatical and Part-Time Officers on students’ academic priorities via close communication with the Education OfficerAttend relevant Consultative Fora sessionsMeet with the other Officers within the Academic Sub-Committee and the Education Officer to discuss issues affecting students across the whole of LSEAny student can run to be an Academic Sub-Committee Officer as long as they are enrolled on a course at LSE that the Officer role represents. For example, only Postgraduate Research students can run for the position of Postgraduate Research Officer; only Part-Time students can run for the position of Part-Time Study Officer. A Teach Out's consist of a teaching session of any variety outside the university structure, to help foster discussion, solidarity and resistance. They are friendly informal spaces, a good way for people to participate in the strike, a way to build staff-student solidarity and breakdown hierarchies in the university. They can involve music, poetry, crafting, conversation, theatre, reflection, reading. They can be about the issues the strike is over (equality, insecure contracts, unsustainable workload, the cost of living crisis), connected issues in higher education (e.g. fees, course cuts), worker’s rights and the history of worker’s struggles around the world, wider related issues like anti-racism, climate justice, the hostile environment for migrants, mental health, housing.General Course PResidentThe General Course President represents General Course students during their short time here at LSE.

Whatever your campaign is about, if you’re passionate about an issue that affects you and your fellow students, it’s important.Am I a campaigner?Campaigns are student-led initiatives which draw attention to ongoing issues and aim to change current policies or create new ones.

Our campaign groups have been leading local and national collectives this year so lets celebrate that power. Including the department based activism being delivered by our ever amazing academic reps.WINNERSAward for Excellent Academic Representation – Camille Bou & Brooke ScholesTogether, Camille and Brooke have effectively represented Health Policy PhD students and made an effort to ensure students’ voices are heard – despite the difficult circumstances we all found ourselves in this year. Camille was praised for having “actively promoted inclusivity and fostered a sense of fraternity during a very stressful period”, while Brooke was praised for connecting students with opportunities and providing suggestions to departmental staff on how to improve their programme. Camille and Brooke have gone above and beyond as academic representatives – thank you both!Award for Advocacy – Melanie AtwoodMelanie has made a huge impact as an academic representative. In her nomination, it was said that “Melanie developed a new approach to SSLC meetings that has made the meetings more efficient and productive. Our students reps have always surveyed the students before each SSLC meeting, but Melanie takes it one step further. She creates a document with the main concerns raised in the survey and includes suggestions for how to address those concerns.” Melanie has been a dedicated and innovative academic representative this year. Congratulations!Award for Outstanding Commitment – Faraz KhalidWe would like to recognise the outstanding commitment of Faraz Khalid. Faraz has gone above and beyond in advocating for his fellow students this year.

More than 600 Academic Reps are elected by their student peers to represent them during the academic year and to liaise with LSE and departmental staff in a variety of committees.What do Academic Representatives do?Academic Reps ensure student concerns are addressed and students have a say in the running of their programme. They raise issues about the quality of the programme and the experience as an LSE student, including the things they love and the things they want improved. Academic Reps also ensure that the department listens directly to student feedback and that issues are resolved as swiftly as possible to improve your teaching and learning experience.Academic Reps can also become Department Reps, attending Consultative Forum once a term to represent their peers to LSE.Academic Representation Structure The Academic Representation system is made up by several roles. BenefitsOne of the great things about being an Academic Rep is that you get to bring all the views of other students together, and be part of improving the quality of the education at the School. You can gain a number of key skills from being an Academic Rep, including attending and sometimes chairing meetings, gathering and collating feedback, identifying key concerns, representing other people, negotiating and seeking student-focused solutions, and communicating with groups of people in different contexts.We also offer a range of rewards and benefits for our Academic Reps, including references and the chance to win the Academic Rep of the Month Awards.How to become an Academic RepAcademic Reps are elected separately for each programme at the start of the Autumn Term (formerly Michaelmas Term), so you will need to contact the leader of your programme, or your programme administrative staff, to find out how to sign up. If you are unsure who to contact, please contact us at the email address below and we will signpost you. This year some departments at LSE are electing their Academic Reps through the LSESU website. If you are part of one of those departments, you will be able to nominate yourself and/ or vote for your Academic Representatives through the Students' Union website. If you are interested in becoming an Academic Rep head to this webpage for more information: https://www.lsesu.com/voice/academic-reps/academic-reps-elections/.  Nominations are currently closed and will reopen for the next election cycle. What to do once you have been elected?Attend training - Show up a session!gather feedback from your cohort(Opens in new tabattend your sslc The links for the above will be sent to you once you are elected.Once you've been elected, you can make the role yours! You should be contacted by your programme at times throughout the year about the meetings you are invited to.

Some of these achieved their goals and came to a natural close, others dissipated into wider movements, and some unfortunately fell by the way-side as their founders graduated and left the LSE campus behind. Perhaps you would like to restart and rebuild an existing campaign or advocate for a new one.If you feel you want to start any of these campaigns again at LSE, reach out to us on su.campaigns@lse.ac.uk.Explore this section:Campaign ArchiveYour Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:44,d7ac52abdb664803f2b0a5cf79fefc21,3.

Similar to a jury system, we use a sortition process to ensure the students selected reflect the LSE student body and bring in their own lived experience when setting Union-wide policy. For example, the number of postgraduate students sitting on the panel will be proportional to the number of postgraduate students in the wider student body.The panel members will be presented with Policy Proposals put forward by their fellow students. The policy proposers, plus any student who wishes to oppose the proposal, will have the opportunity to present their case to the panel. ""Informed voices"", including people with lived experience of any issue being discussed, will also be invited to present their perspective on the proposal.Panellists will have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the proposal in depth together, before voting on whether they believe the proposal should pass. For more information on the different voting options of the Student Panel, and what the outcomes of each are, have a look at our Policy Proposal page.If you would like to attend the Student Panel to hear what Policy Proposals have been put forward and what the student panellists discuss, then you are more than welcome to. The panel will be hosted in a hybrid format, so you can attend in person or online. However, Student Panel observers cannot input into the discussion or interact with the panellists in any way. How CaN I Take Part in A Student Panel?There are lots of different ways you can get involved in Panels! You can take part as a:1. Policy ProposerIf you have an idea to improve life at LSE, you can submit your policy for review at an upcoming student panel. All the information you need is on this page. 2. Policy OpposerIf someone submits a policy to student panel that you disagree with, you can put yourself forward to oppose the policy. You would present your opposition case to the Student Panel, and the Panellists would be able to ask you questions.You can view all the Policies that have been proposed by other students here. If you don't believe a policy should pass, please get in touch with us at su.democracy@lse.ac.uk and we can talk you through becoming a Policy Opposer.3. ""Informed voices""""Informed voices"" are people who have expert knowledge on the policy area being discussed, or who have lived experience relevant to the policy. ""Informed voices"" can be anyone, not just students, and they provide their perspective to the panellists after the Proposer and Opposer have both spoken. They can also be asked questions by the Panellists.If you believe you, or someone you know, would be a helpful for an upcoming Policy Proposal, please contact us at su.democracy@lse.ac.uk and we can talk you through the next steps.4. PanellistFor every Student Panel we need a group of 18-48 students who are randomly selected to act as a representative sample of the student body. These panellists deliberate and make decisions on Policy Proposals. In return for their time, panellists receive a £40 voucher for each session they attend - and, of course, free pizza!If you would like to put yourself forward to be selected for the next Student Panel, you just need to complete the selection survey sent out to students at the beginning of each year.5. ObserverAll students are welcome to attend any Student Panel as an Observer. This can be in person or online via Zoom (to receive the Zoom link, please sign up for a ticket on the Panel event page or message us at su.democracy@lse.ac.uk).In order to maintain the integrity of the Panel's democratic format, we ask Observers to please remain quiet and to not interact with the panellists.6. Democracy Committee MemberThe Democracy Committee are elected students entrusted to uphold the democratic integrity of the Union. A key aspect of their role is facilitating the smooth running of our Student Panels. This ranges from reviewing Policy Proposals as they are submitted, deciding which Policies progress to Student Panel (if we receive more than the maximum 6 which can be discussed at any one Panel), inviting Expert Witnesses, and chairing and facilitating the Panels themselves. Democracy Committee Members are elected in Lent Term each year and receive an honorarium for their work throughout the year. You can find out more about nominating yourself for a Democracy Committee position here, or contact us at su.democracy@lse.ac.uk if you would like to talk to a member of staff about elections.This year's Panels and DeadlinesSpring Term Student Panel 23/24Deadline to submit policy: 9am, Tuesday 30th April 2024Panel: 5pm, Tuesday 21st May 2024Autumn Term Student Panel 23/24Deadline to submit policy: 9am, Monday 30th October 2023Panel: 5:30pm, Tuesday 14th November 2023 Upcoming Student Panel Policy ProposalsThe Policy Proposals going forward to the next Student Panel can be found below:Read about the outcomes of previous Student Panels hereSee the latest updates on passed Policies hereSee all policies that have been proposed but not yet discussed at a Panel on our Current Proposed Policies pageIf Policy Proposals are put forward to Town Hall and an all-student vote, you will be able to vote for them below:There are no referenda running at the present time.Explore this section:Previous Student PanelsYour Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:44,3371b0e8e157c50da922262566467e00,Student Panels,https://www.lsesu.com/voice/student-panels/

The programme involves matching students with LSE alumni based on a series of characteristics and preferences. These matched mentors and mentees then meet regularly from November through to July with support from LSESU staff, including training, events, and networking sessions.The scheme aims to create a community of BME students and LSE alumni that can draw upon each other for support and knowledge throughout their degree and beyond. Information for MentorsWe’re looking for LSE alumni to mentor BME LSE students. If you’re looking for a new challenge, or want to pass on some of your wisdom to a current LSE student, this is the opportunity for you!We expect all mentors to maintain regular contact with their mentees, catching up at least once per month. If you are matched with a mentee, we will get in touch with guidance on mentoring to help you through the process, including information on appropriate topics to discuss, how to set up effective communication, and safeguarding. The ideal mentor would feel comfortable sharing their own experience at University and beyond, and be motivated to support their mentee in both their personal and career development.If you have any questions or inquiries about the mentoring scheme, get in touch with us at bme.mentoring@lsesu.com.Applications for the BME Mentoring Scheme 2023/24 are now closed. Applications will reopen in 2024 for the 2024/25 cohort.APPLY TO BE A MENTOR Information for MenteesLSESU’s BME Mentoring Scheme connects BME students with some of LSE’s alumni, providing students with valuable guidance and insight into different industries.All mentees who are successfully matched with a mentor are expected to maintain regular contact with the mentor, catching up at least once a month. Please do not sign up for the scheme if you are unsure if you can commit to this. A mentorship is a partnership and you will be expected to commit a couple of hours each month to preparing, discussing, and consolidating the topics you cover with your mentor.In the application form below, you will be able to specify any preferences you have about your potential mentor and we will try to match you with someone who matches those criteria. However, it may not be possible for us to do so in all instances.If you have any questions about the scheme, you can email bme.mentoring@lsesu.com.Applications for the BME Mentoring Scheme 2023/24 are now closed.

The student Union host DSF every year to promote the wellbeing of our students at LSE; mitigate exam stress and encourage them to prioritise their mental. If there was ever a time to de-stress this was it!If you missed some all of it or you’d just like to relive the good times, here's a recap of our Top 5 moments from #DSF2022!           5. Chill OutThere was a number of ways to get your 'chill' on with us: students were treated to a number of services including acupuncture and massages from our on-campus Treatment Clinic and gong meditation sessions with The Zen Project.             You could also stop by and chat with our Wellbeing Service, join a spirited game of table tennis and grab a free tea or coffee.                                                                              4. Make and DoIf you were looking to get creative during Destress Fest the options were endless. You could do some relaxing colouring of a map of campus or for more of a challenge: you could join a pottery class with Sculpd or try Leather Craft. Our rooftop painting sessions were also an excellent way to make new friends.            3. Fun In the TunsOur Student Bar The Three Tuns hosted a number of events, keeping in mind the students during exam season looking for some respite in the evening after a day-long shift at the library. You could sing your heart out in Karaoke, channel your inner mastermind at the Quiz Nights, or get your life at our Drag Bingo night.                              2. Let's get Physical! If you were looking to get active, stay active or try something new to get fit; this DSF you were truly spoilt for choice.

Puppies! Who could forget the crowning jewel of DSF this year: Puppies on Campus, where we were lucky enough to be visited by our friends at The Cuddle Club. Our fluffy four legged friends brougth immeasureable amounts of joy to the campus and there was lots snuggles and selfies involved. We think it's safe to say this was the highlight of DSF; the queue to hang out with the lovely dogs spoke for it's self!        Bonus. Freebies!If you were too busy to join a class or attend an event or the SU team was out on campus, handing out freebies including stress balls, hot chocolate and tea packets, keep cups and even packets of seeds for our green-fingered students.              We’ve so immensely enjoyed putting on DeStress Fest this year and we hope you have too.

Policy Proposals can be submitted on anything ranging from decisions taken by LSE or LSESU, to wider national or even international concerns.How do I write and submit a Policy Proposal?Any member of the Students' Union can submit a Policy Proposal so why not go for it? Every Proposal needs three things:A title. Make it short, easy to understand and a question. For example: Should LSESU make elections paperless?A clear issue. explain the issue in simple terms, and include references for any facts or stats. For example: LSESU provides free printing for election candidates in Michaelmas and Lent term elections (LSESU Election Rules Document 2018) which means a huge amount of paper used twice a year.A solution. Again, it's important to keep it simple and realistic! For example: LSESU should work to phase out unnecessary paper usage with the aim to go paperless by 2025. How do I get my policy proposal passed? If the Democracy Committee submits your Policy Proposal to the Student Panel, LSESU will contact you directly to let you know the date that it’ll be debated.At the Student Panel you’ll need to present your policy. You should be ready to take questions from students and discuss any suggested changes to the proposal offered by other students. Your proposal will then be voted on by the Panellists. If 75% or more think your policy should be introduced, it passes. If 75% or more think that your policy should not be introduced, it fails (although you can still propose your policy again at future Student Panels). If less than 75% consensus is reached amongst the panellists, your proposal will go forward to the next Town Hall.If your proposal is passed on to the Town Hall, you will present your proposal again, after which a week of campaigning will commence. An all-student vote will then be administered over 24 hours, where all students have the opportunity to vote for our against your policy. If more than 50% of votes are in favour of your policy, it will become official SU policy until the end of the next academic year. What should I do before submitting a policy proposal? Check the proposal you want to propose isn’t Union policy already. All LSESU policy is available online.Make it relevant to students. People will vote for something that will positively benefit them, so show how your policy directly affects students. If your policy is about a national or international issue, try and relate it to LSE life.Be realistic. Your proposal should be practical, realistic and achievable.  Proposing that the Union should lobby LSE to give every student a laptop, for example, is likely to be a waste of time. If the proposal does have a financial impact, consider if it’s viable or if the financial impact could be offset.Gather support before submitting your Policy Proposal. If it’s clear that the policy has widespread support among students, it’s much more likely to succeed.If your proposal goes forward to an all-student vote, be prepared to campaign. Putting up posters, writing articles and leafleting are all great campaigning tools. But the most important thing you can do is to talk to students directly and explain why it’s in their interests to support you.Be accurate. Remember to give sources for any quotes, statistics or facts. The Democracy Committee is likely to send your proposal back if it believes you’ve provided inaccurate information or information that isn’t properly referenced or backed up.Be aware of restrictions. Your proposal can't explicitly spend the resources of the union, as this is this is the remit of the Trustee Board. Proposals also cannot name, or make identifiable, staff of the union, or determine the overall strategy of the union. Finally, motions cannot compel LSESU’s ordinary members to do anything or compel any outside organisation to do anything - this INCLUDES the school. For example, a proposal couldn’t demand LSE to extend its holidays, but it could mandate the union to lobby for this change. What happens at a Student Panel? The Student Panel Chair will call you up give you each approximately 2 minutes to speak (the exact timing depends on how many proposals need to be debated).Make sure you’re on time, and know what you want to say. It’s a good idea to have some notes written down. Concentrate on speaking in defence of your proposal, as persuasively as you can!If anyone wants to speak against your proposal, they can either notify the Democracy Committee in advance, to ensure that they definitely have an opportunity to speak, or just put their hand up on the day. They will also have about two minutes to put forward their opposition.The Democracy Committee will also invite experts and people with lived experience of the issue you are proposing to provide a rounder perspective of your proposal. If you have any recommendations or suggestions for individuals to speak in relation to your proposal, please message su.democracy@lse.ac.uk.Following the initial opening statements from the proposer, any opposers, and the invited speakers, there is time for questions from the Student Panellists. After this, the Panellists will discuss amongst themselves the merits of the proposal, potentially putting forwward adaptations to the proposal which will be approved or denied by the Democracy Committee.The Student Panel Chair will then ask for a show of hands from the Student Panellists, on whether they support or oppose the Policy Proposal. This show of hands will determine whether the policy is approved, if it falls, or if it is passed on for discussion at the Student Town Hall. What happens at a Town Hall? If your policy goes forward to all-student vote, campaigning is the best way to ensure your proposal receives the support required to become policy. You’ll build a consensus surrounding your issue and give your policy greater weight and importance.Here are some ways you might want to engage people:Contact The Beaver to secure media coverage of your campaignOrganise a photo opportunity with your campaignersUse social media to get your message outCome into the SU Office to book a stall on Sheffield StreetLSE has a strong history of campaigning and at LSESU we’ll support you in any way we can, for Policy Proposals and wider LSESU or national campaigns. Please contact the Representation Team on su.representation@lse.ac.uk to find out how we can help. Timeline of a policy proposal You will hear back from the Democracy Committee within a week of your submission. If your Proposal is progressing on to the Student Panel you will be informed a minimum of 1 week in advance.Useful termsDemocracy CommitteeFive elected students who are responsible for ensuring that democracy functions properly within LSESU.Policy ProposalA suggested policy put forward that students debate and then vote on. If the proposal passes it becomes official LSESU policy.OppositionThe student who disagrees with the Proposal and argues against it.Order paperThe agenda for Student Panels and Town Halls. This will be made available online ahead of the meetings.ProposerThe person who submits the Policy Proposal. They need to give their name and student ID number.QuorumThe number of students who must vote on a Policy Proposal (at an all student vote) for the result to be binding.When you submit a proposal you will receive acknowledgement within one working day. The proposal will be forwarded onto Democracy Committee within five working days (this will normally be much quicker).Once a proposal is with Democracy Committee they will respond to the proposer within three working days with feedback, explaining which feedback is optional and which is mandatory for the proposal to be heard.The Democracy Committee will inform you when they need to receive the finalised proposal by in order it to go to the next Student Panel.Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:45,0bb387bca52d96018fb65e2d2d702466,Policy Proposals Guide,https://www.lsesu.com/voice/policy-proposal/guide/

Current Proposed PoliciesCurrent Proposed PoliciesFind out more about the policies your fellow students think will improve life at LSE!What are the current proposed policies?This page lists the Policy Proposals going forward to the next Student Panel (Tuesday 21st of May 2024). Please note that we undergo a review process with the proposers before the panels and so these are liable to change:1. Should LSESU seek dialogue with LSE senior leadership to press for full and meaningful divestment from fossil fuels and weapons, including indirect investments? Issue:Although LSE does not invest directly in any companies, it has significant indirect investments in fossil fuels and weapons companies. Several of LSE's Fund Managers are involved in financing fossil fuel and weapons companies, and one, JP Morgan, has ranked first in fossil fuel financing since 2016 according to the Rainforest Action Network. Moreover, LSESU Palestine Society’s recently published investment report Assets in Apartheid: LSE’s Complicity in Genocide of the Palestinian People, Arms Trade, and Climate Breakdown finds significant governance and transparency issues related to LSE’s investments and ESG policy. These investments and related policy issues contradict the spirit of LSE's ESG commitments, undermine its world-leading reputation, and send a discouraging message to students who are actively working towards a more sustainable future.  Solution:SESU should seek dialogue with LSE senior leadership to press for full and meaningful divestment from fossil fuels and weapons, including indirect investments. More specifically, based on the recommendations of the Assets in Apartheid report, LSESU should make the following demands of LSE leadership in terms of governance, transparency, and divestment: Governance Launch a transparent investigation to understand how and why LSE currently invests in companies that violate the spirit of its ESG policy and why the current LSE Asset Managers were selected; this should include ways to repair harm caused by these investment decisions. Reconfigure the Investments Sub-committee to include meaningful and democratic faculty and student representation and oversight. Establish an open process to update the ESG policy with substantial input from key LSE stakeholders, including the LSESU, LSE UCU, interested student societies, and faculty with expertise with ESG investments. This process should include mechanisms for all stakeholders to approve the new policy rather than only be consulted on it. Establish regular feedback loops between the Investments Sub-committee and key LSE stakeholders to review the investments portfolio and its governance. Such stakeholders should include the LSESU Palestine Society, LSE UCU, Academic Board, LSE Transition Pathway Initiative Centre, the Just Transition Finance Lab, and other relevant student societies and faculty with expertise in ESG investments and their relation to human rights violations, corporate complicity, disarmament, and just climate futures. Create and publish a policy regarding unacceptable business activities of the LSE Asset Managers and mutual fund managers that aligns with LSE’s ESG policy; consequently, this may necessitate selecting new fund managers that align with LSE’s principles. Create procedures for cases when LSE Asset Managers have selected funds that are not compliant with the ESG policy; this should include accountability mechanisms. Establish a reporting and investigatory system whereby LSE members can register any violations of the ESG policy and any other types of fund mismanagement. Establish a system for keeping up to date on corporate complicity in relation to the arms trade, climate breakdown, and human rights violations. Transparency Publish the Investment Policy and Mandate and the Annual Investment Review by the Investments Sub-committee. Create and produce an annual report written for LSE members and to be published with the investment portfolio. This annual report should detail how the investments portfolio aligns with LSE’s ESG policy and list all of LSE’s financial relationships through the portfolio, including with bond issuers, investee companies, mutual fund managers, and LSE Asset Managers.269 The relationship to the company should be explicitly tied to a holding. The report should be written in accessible, jargon-free language. Provide links to the annual reports of all mutual funds with the publication of the investment's portfolio. Institutionalise dedicated quarterly checks and reports with the LSE Asset Managers to review how investments are in line with LSE’s ESG policy. Include the full name of the bond issuers in the publication of the investment's portfolio. Release all information on the funds managed by Mercer. Divestment Announce LSE’s intention to divest from all companies involved in human rights violations; extraction and/or distribution of fossil fuels; proliferation and/or manufacture of arms; and financing of fossil fuel companies and/or weapons producers. Immediately divest from all mutual funds that contain companies involved in any of these egregious activities. This includes holdings that invest in companies designated by the UN as involved in activities that violate the rights of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and any that comprise companies supplying the Israeli military. Investigate all avenues to remove investments in bonds issued by companies involved in egregious activities. Meanwhile, LSE should distance itself from these investments and pledge to no longer provide financing to these companies. Instruct LSE Asset Managers not to invest in any companies, whether through bonds or mutual funds, listed in Appendix B of the Assets in Apartheid report or a comparable and more complete report or resource. The resources listed in Appendix A of the report should be used to check for compliance with future investments. Publish a report on the status of divestment from companies engaged in egregious activities one year after the initial announcement of commitment to divest.2. Should the LSESU adopt an official policy in favour of the decriminalisation of sex work and lobby LSE to provide more support for student sex workers? Issue:Even pre-pandemic, 1/5 of students had considered doing sex work [1] and estimates are that up to 200,000 students are currently involved in sex work [2]  This number is rising due to the ongoing cost of living crisis. Students are engaged in sex work mainly to cover their cost of living and study. That means student sex workers are a demographic that need tailored support by the Students’ Union and support by the university more broadly.  While sex work is not technically illegal in the UK, working with others indoors (even if for safety purposes) is criminalised as “brothel keeping” and street-based sex workers are regularly charged with loitering and soliciting. Those involved in online sex work are constantly at risk of being outed or having their data misused by large online platforms. All the negative effects of criminalisation are compounded by stigma, prevalent in the university context too, both among students and staff. This means that student sex workers are less able to speak about their experience, advocate for their needs, and access support services. In addition to being discriminated against under ‘morality’ clauses in accommodation and ‘fit to practice’ policies on university courses, sex working students experience breaches of confidentiality where staff disclose their sex working status without their consent when approached for support.  Solution:An acknowledgement by LSESU that some students at LSE are already engaging in sex work to cover their cost of living and study, and an explicit commitment to their safety and wellbeing.  LSESU to take an official stance in support of decriminalisation.  Unions at UCL and Goldsmiths[3] have done so and students have reported “feeling more able to talk to university staff if I need support and speaking up about what I need - it just feels like the institution is no longer actively trying to harm me by directly criminalizing me, or at the very least being complicit in the criminalisation of the work I do in order to study and live in the first place”.  Having an official stance in favour of decriminalization reduces stigma, which means student sex workers can access better support without judgment.  An explicit policy should be modelled on policies drafted by sex worker led organisations – an example, drafted by students organising with the sex worker led English Collective of Prostitutes is here:  This union commits to supporting the full decriminalization of sex work in order to better protect student sex workers from discrimination, stigma and violence. A policy that prohibits non-voluntary disclosures by staff when approached by students about their sex working status. Training for staff on this issue.  Look into providing accessible hardship funds for people engaged in sex work or other informal sector survival work, so they can leave (or reduce) the amount of sex work they must do.  Comprehensive review of policies and guidelines (including discriminatory ‘morality’ clauses and ‘fit to practice’ policies). Lobbying the LSE to implement these same commitments to student sex worker safety and wellbeing. Footnotes:[1] https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/1000112/healthy-relationships-with-yourself-and-others/1780/students-engaged-in-sex-work  [2] https://thetab.com/uk/2021/09/20/thousands-of-students-are-sex-workers-universities-need-to-do-more-to-protect-them-222364  [3] https://www.goldsmithssu.org/pageassets/activism/democracy/policies/active/2014-15-Supporting-student-sex-workers.pdf https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-and-support/advice/student-sex-workers 3. Should the LSESU facilitate and support Spaces and Performances for Creative Arts Societies?Issue: LSESU Creative Societies encounter many difficulties and obstacles in their basic function: putting on performances and giving students a space for creative exploration and expression. This is primarily due to the following: - Securing performance spaces for our productions can be very difficult due to external and academic bookings being given priority over ours.  - The lack of storage space for Drama Society props/set/costumes apart from a singular cupboard in the Old Building.  - Difficulty in communicating with LSE teams and staff such as the Estates Team, AV Team, and Porters, and limited success in agreed requests being delivered  - The Weston Studio in the Marshall was designed as a black box theatre space, fully equipped with curtains and some lanterns – however (I believe) there is a lack of a lighting desk from which the equipment can be operated.  Solution:- Avoiding taking bookings when societies have already confirmed them, especially to external third parties.  - Provision of a small storage space dedicated to drama in the SU building (possibly in the storage area of the ARC?).  - To provide better training and support for students in communication with the Estates Team, AV Team, and Porters to advocate for changes such as repairing broken lights in the Old Theatre, removal of the lecture podium before rehearsals and performances where possible, and help is delivering set as requested.  - A potential installation/looking into the possibility of a lighting desk/tech facilities in the Weston Studio to utilise its design, and/or an updated lighting desk in The Venue (which would also benefit the LSESU when hosting events in the space) If you would like to oppose any of the above proposals, or you would like to speak (or recommend someone to speak) at the Student Panel as an expert or person with lived experience, please get in touch at su.democracy@lse.ac.ukIf you would like to hear the discussions surrounding whether the above policies are approved, please come along to our next Student Panels as an observer!Find out more about the Policy Proposal and Student Panel process here. Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:45,8b249ae86406b12aec549ab57c713024,Current Proposed Policies,https://www.lsesu.com/voice/policy-proposal/proposedpolicies/

We have kept as many activities as possible free and the prices we are charging have been kept to a minimum.How do I know if an activity is free or costs money?When you click on the activity there will either be a ticket option, with price attached, or no ticket option. All the activities with no ticket option are free!Some of the tickets are £0, is this an error?Good news! This is not an error. For some activities we have assigned free tickets so we can limit the number of people attending due to space. If you want to attend, please make sure you purchase one of the free tickets before attending the session. Some of the events may require booking through Eventbrite instead of our website. For these events, there will be a link in the blurb of the event.Some activities have tickets and others don’t, how do I reserve my space for non-ticketed activities?For non-ticketed events it is a case of just turning up at the start of the event.

Your welfare is our top priority and we wanted to remind you that you can access support at LSE at any time during the break, via this page and your SU is here too. If you need us, please drop us an email at su.info@lse.ac.uk.Below we have published some guidance for our student community to help us all navigate the difficult circumstances. We welcome any feedback. OverviewAt LSE Students’ Union we are not experts on Israel and Palestine, and we do not imagine we have the answers to this ongoing humanitarian crisis.Our simple message is that we stand against terrorism, war, and violence against all human beings. We believe that international law must be adhered to. Israeli and Palestinian people have the right to live in peace and prosperity, free from terrorism, free from occupation, free from violence, free from fear.We know that violence in Israel and Palestine means a higher risk of antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian and anti-Israeli incidents in the UK, and on our campus.This is, therefore, a moment to support students, stand firm in tackling hate-speech and abuse, and de-escalate fear and tension on campus.For students this is a moment to show leadership by speaking and acting with compassion and sensitivity for fellow students no matter their identity or their politics.We encourage all our students at LSE to show leadership in the words they choose and the actions they take in response to the crisis.In practice, this means:Speak and act with compassion, sensitivity and humanityTry to be generous in spirit to people who are reacting from a place of pain and fearRead up on how to talk about Israel and Palestine in an inclusive wayGo out of your way to make sure Jewish, Israeli, Muslim and Palestinian students feel - and are - safe and welcomeDon’t stand by if you witness antisemitism, Islamophobia, or anti-Palestinian abuse or violence take place – report it, have the difficult conversation with a friend, take actionNever interrupt a vigil with ‘counter-messaging’ or put opposing stickers on top of a posterNever justify, celebrate, or excuse the violence, killing or suffering in Israel and PalestineNever target Jewish, Israeli, Muslim or Palestinian students with hate or abuse, don’t assume their political beliefs, and don’t demand that they take a ‘stance’ Responding to hate speech, discrimination, hatecrimes, and abuseBystander intervention: If it is safe to do so and you feel able to, you can consider if an intervention is appropriate. Options for bystander intervention include:direct intervention: e.g. tell someone their speech is harmful or take someone aside for a conversationdistract: e.g. create a bit of space in the situation that allows someone to exitdelegate: e.g. approach someone senior in your SU or at an event and ask them to intervenedocument what’s happening: e.g. take a note of what is being said/done and by whom Approach the victim: Approach the target of the abuse. Ask if they are OK. Ask if you can help in anyway - for example accompanying them as they leave a harmful situation and staying with them until a friend gets there. Find a safe place for them to sit down. Help them report the incident.Report it: Reporting discriminatory incidents, hate crimes, and hate speech is incredibly important even if nothing can be done about a specific incident or it has already been dealt with informally. Options to report include:Report an incident via LSE, Report it, Stop It, here If you see or experience antisemitism report it to the Community Security Trust hereIf you see or experience islamophobia, report it to Tell Mama here The Union of Jewish Students have opened a Welfare Hotline for students on 02074243288Support and information about Islamophobia from the Muslim Council of Britain is here Report hate crime to the Police here New guidance for Students & Student GroupsAt LSESU, we are constantly reviewing our policies and procedures as the crisis in the Middle East escalates. As a result we are updating our guidance to inform and protect our students and mitigate any risks. We also want to ensure that we are doing all we can to ensure we are giving our diverse membership a safe space to express their views, debate in constructive and respectful and campaign for the issues that are important to them.We encourage students to get in touch with us via email: su.info@lse.ac.uk  A note on unlawful speech and proscribed organisations: Whilst education institutions and students’ unions have a duty to uphold free speech, they also have a clear duty to stop unlawful speech. It is important that students and students’ unions are clear on what constitutes unlawful speech. In the current context there is a higher risk of the following types of unlawful speech: hate speech, inciting violence, inciting terrorism, or inviting support for a proscribed organisation.  Unlawful speech under current UK law:Threat to killProvocation or threat of violenceSpeech intended or likely to stir uphatred on the grounds of sexualorientation, race or religionInciting terrorismInviting support for a ‘proscribedorganisation’Intentional harassment, alarm or distressDefamation /Malicious communicationssigned statements and open lettersWe know that there will be many Open Letters and Statements circulating in support of various positions. We strongly recommend that, unless all members of your student group are in agreement, you only sign these on behalf of yourself as an individual and not as a student group. Also, we advise you to take the time to read exactly what you are signing.Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:46,527adb984b544f6bd927bc4ee6017efa,Support and Guidance,https://www.lsesu.com/support/support_and_guidance/

From micro aggressions, to explicit acts of racism LSESU wants to ensure you that we are working closely with LSE to ensure that all instances of racism are effBelow is a guide written by your Anti-Racism Officer on how to navigate and report any forms of racism at LSE. Additionally, all the relevant information can also be found on the LSE website.Step 1: LSE advises you to talk to a safe contact who can offer you support and advice if you want to report any racial harassment you face. The safe contact scheme allows students to receive confidential support and advice from staff who have gone through training (not only for racial harassment but also bullying and sexual harassment). There are 39 safe contacts across 25 departments/divisions. You can find that list here.Step 2: If you’re feeling up to it and want to make a report about the harassment you've received, you can fill in the LSE Report It! Stop It! Form to make a formal complaint. Although not explicitly stating that this is the way to report racism - racism would fall under “sexual harassment, bullying and/or harassment”. Here you can anonymously report the incident however if you want LSE to follow up and you can include your contact details. Step 3: What happens next? The report you submit will be sent to the Student Services Advice Team who will review your report and take the necessary action e.g. disciplinary action if they think it's required. You will receive a response within 3 working days. You will be contacted to discuss what action that you stated you want to be taken.Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:46,23f112919381871cf97e7d738ef17be7,Reporting Racism at LSE,https://www.lsesu.com/support/reportingracismatlse/

We know that COVID-19 has affected many of our staff and students in various ways; we also acknowledge that there is a population of students on campus who are suffering the effects of Long Covid or Post Covid-Symptoms. We are aware the effects of this long term illness manifest themselves in a number of different ways for each individual person; therefore the Student Union have committed to amplifying the voice of students suffering from these conditions.What is Long Covid/Post Covid SyndromeFor some people, coronavirus (COVID-19) can cause symptoms that last weeks or months after the infection has gone. This is sometimes called post-COVID-19 syndrome or ""long COVID"". You can find more information on Long-Covid hereThe NICE guideline scope published on 30 October 2020 defines post-COVID syndrome as signs and symptoms that develop during or following an infection consistent with COVID-19 which continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis.

LSE library is the only loud library I have come across. It is extremely difficult to sit andconcentrate on work when there is so much noise around. Silent zones are so futile if theadjacent zones are spaces where students can discuss and talk loudly in groups.Solution:The suggestion entails the conversion of a substantial portion of the library intodesignated silent zones, featuring only specialised rooms and pods (similar to those in LG)for facilitating group discussions.It has been observed that the area near the desktop computers tends to be particularlynoisy, thus prompting the proposal for the establishment of a dedicated computer room.Given the library's circular and open architectural layout, it is noted that noise tends topropagate easily, which leads to the recommendation for designating the entire LSE libraryas a complete silent zone.While recognizing the need for accommodating group discussions and collaborative work, itis worth noting that there are ample study spaces throughout the campus intended for thesepurposes unlike silent zones.LSE to provide other rooms that can be booked on campus for silent study? Should the LSESU and PfAL (Programme for African Leadership)	collectively work to mitigate and eliminate diversity and inclusion	challenges faced by African students on campus?Issue:Student diversity and inclusion in the following enduring areas that adversely impact African students at the LSE:1) Lack of diversity and inclusivity: African students, as a minority group within the LSE, may confront feelings of inadequacy or imposter syndrome if the institution’s faculty, staff, and curriculum fail to adequately reflect diversity and inclusivity. A lack of representation can erode our sense of belonging within the academic community.2) Bias and discrimination: Regrettably, African students may encounter prejudices and microaggressions fuelled by racism and bias which can negatively impact our academic, and social experiences.3) Feelings of isolation and access to support: the geographical and cultural distance from home communities can lead to profound feelings of isolation among African students. This coupled with challenges of adapting to a new environment, cultural shocks and language barriers, can sometimes hinder our ability to connect with our peers and seek support. African students may be less inclined to seek essential support services in mental health, academic challenges and/or career guidance due to stigma and cultural norms surrounding these issues; which may further undermine their overall wellbeing and academic success.Solution: Our response to these enduring concerns is ‘UBUNTU’. Ubuntu is an African philosophy of togetherness, equality and humanity. Therefore, we believe, initiatives such as prioritising diversity in all spheres such as the faculty/staff hiring process, food options available at the cafeterias, career and wellness services available, providing training to promote inclusive behaviours and/or auditing the curricula to expand it beyond the androcentric and eurocentric ideals will go a long way.We propose the following interventions:1) Prioritise diversity in the faculty/staff hiring process.2) Review of study literature, curricular and reading lists to better reflect the African perspectives.3) Greater support for students over the course of the dissertation period4) Creation of a diversified and racially inclusive support service team (i.e careers and wellness) that understands the peculiarities and contexts of African students.5) Departments to announce and plan international trips much further in advance to allow for students with restrictive visas to make plans, and to arrange for any short notice trips to be held in the UK SHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY LSE TO ADMINISTER SELF-CERTIFIED EXTENSIONS FOR STUDENTS?Issue:Although those with disabilities get adjustments, many are undiagnosed, waiting for years for an assessment (often for neurodivergency) or do not meet the criteria even if it adversely affects their studies (often those with short-term conditions) LSE may be trying to maintain academic rigour with stringent exam practices, but this may be detrimental to students' wellbeingThere is no correlation between UK University league table position and their extension policySolution: LSESU to lobby LSE to facilitate a 48-hour self-certification extension twice a yearLSESU to lobby LSE departments to facilitate a self certification extension based on best practices determined by the SULSESU to lobby LSE to implement different extension types for different conditionsLSESU should lobby for self extension standards should be consistent across all departmentsLSESU and LSE should take learnings from COVID 19 approach to extensions Voting OutcomesShould the LSESU lobby for the LSE library to better support silent study? PASSEDShould the LSESU and PfAL (Programme for African Leadership) collectively work to mitigate and eliminate diversity and inclusion challenges faced by African students on campus? PASSEDShould the LSESU lobby LSE to administer self-certified extensions for students?

I felt very uncomfortable in my accommodation as it was rundown and felt unsafe.One night a random man was able to enter my room using his key and after this incident, I knew I had to move out of this accommodation. However, I could not afford to break my lease and move elsewhere. I was very low on funds and this accommodation was all I could afford. This took a huge toll on my studies and mental health. I was considering deferring my degree and returning to my home country.Someone suggested that I reach out to the LSESU and explain my situation. I did and was told to apply to the LSESU Hardship Fund. I applied and was awarded a generous grant that would allow me to move out of my current accommodation. I moved into an LSE hall where I felt much safer.

Get in touch.Graduation is one of the most joyful times of the year, if you're not in financial hardship. For those who are, our funds could help by waiving the full gown hire fee and/or cost of graduation photographs. The Graduation Support Funds are managed and monitored by our Advice Service, independent from LSE.APPLICATIONS FOR JULY 2024 GRADUATIONS are NOW CLOSEDAm I eligible?The GGSF & GPSF are open to all graduating students. The full eligibility criteria can be found in the Guidance Document.Download guidance(Opens in new tab)How do I apply?Those wishing to apply should first read the Guidance Document for information regarding application and eligibility criteria. You should then complete the Application form and email it across to su.advice@lse.ac.uk, along with your corresponding evidence.Download application form(Downloads a Word document)TestimonialA Cambridge graduate once told me: if you study your Master's at LSE, either because you are rich or because you want to be rich. I didn't want to pretend this was completely true on me. Life is hard for everyone from different aspects. As an international student, trying to stay in this city and find a proper job with visa sponsorship is never easy. Not because you are not excellent, because this is how things work here. We have got a lot of pressure to deal with.I know many of us would feel shame to apply for some sponsorships for the gown, exactly as what my mom told me when she learned I wanted to work in a restaurant to support my life in London. What I really appreciate is the way that SU offered this opportunity. I felt respected and supported. And most importantly, the whole communication let me feel here we are not only expected to be top billers or world changers, we are expected to be human, be authentic about ourselves. Sometimes in a very competitive environment, it needs a lot of courage to admit you are not okay and you need support. It doesn't only relate to this gown support fund, but career advice, mental health care and a lot of other things. I am proud that LSE is doing better and better on this, and I am proud SU stills gives me this kind of support when I am about to leave the university.The Support Fund did not only allow me to take part in graduation, but also to do so without having to stress about it in advance. I could have saved up, but a cost this significant would have made me stressed weeks or even months in advance. Having this support, I am able to celebrate with my colleagues without feeling bad for spending the money on a gown, not food.

More information to be updated over Summer 2024. How do they work?All elections will run online, through the SU website. No elections are permitted to take place in person, but you're welcome to host an election hustings where nominees discuss their manifestos / address potential voters. Please submit an event form for these if you do want to host one.All elections will be set up for you, and all of your group's members will be emailed with information about nominations, voting, and the results that follow.All you need to do from your end is promote the elections to your members, and encourage people to nominate themselves for roles.Please note: Candidates are not permitted to spend any money on campaigning or creating promotional materials for their run in the elections.CORE ROLESThere are 3 core roles that every affiliated group must have:Presidents are routinely responsible for the overseeing of the whole Club/Society, and their activities including events, finances, and engaging new members throughout the year.Treasurers are routinely responsible for the overseeing of the Club/Society finances for the year, including budgeting for small and large scale events, as well as ensuring that membership funds are spent appropriately to benefit all members.Secretaries are required to support the President and Treasurer where necessary, including in the planning of events, the chairing of committee meetings, and the distributing of notes from these meetings where needed. They may also be responsible for planning social events for the group's members.WHY BE ON A COMMITTEE?Being on a committee is a great way to develop your skills, meet new people and hopefully have lots of fun! It's your chance to shape your group and make your members' voices heard. The SU are here to support you every step of the way. Here's what some of our recent committee members said about their time on a committee:""Being a part of the Drama Society’s committee has been the foremost highlight of my time at LSE. Not only was it an excellent way to de-stress and do something different at the end of every day, but as a member of the committee, it also allowed me to share my love of theatre and foster the same love in others, building a community. Most importantly, however, being a part of the committee allowed me to form long-lasting friendships and relationships that will extend beyond my time at LSE, for which I will always be enormously grateful.""- Lara, Drama Society, President 2022/23.'My position was an unique opportunity to organise the largest events for one of LSE’s largest societies. I gained so many skills from taking responsibility for these projects, recruiting and working with a subcommittee, and balancing them with my academic and other extracurricular commitments. A particular highlight was working with some of the world’s most pre-eminent economists during our Economics Symposium. To anyone thinking about running for a committee position, I’d definitely recommend going for it!'- Edward, Economics Society, President 2022/23. ""Being involved in society committees was most certainly the highlight of my university experience. The skills I gained, the confidence I have developed, and the opportunities I have been given have transformed me into a successful leader who now makes positive changes to this world. In what is a truly unique experience, being a committee member gives you the chance to meet remarkable individuals and professionals whilst providing fantastic opportunities for your members. Furthermore, not only do you get to deliver such fantastic events and legacies to the LSE community, you also get build a team and network of friends who all share the same interests as you.""- Navin, United Nations Society Society, President 2022/23. ""Being a president of society is a great way to improve your leadership and team management skills, while at the same time giving back to a much wider community.""- Danylo, Ukrainian Society, President 2021/ 22 and 2022/23. ""Being part of university societies has been an integral part of my time at LSE. Just joining societies as a member has allowed me to learn so much and meet amazing new people, but particularly being President of various societies has taught me invaluable lessons about leadership and working in a team. Joining the committee of a society and helping to build a community is an incredibly rewarding experience and one that I would genuinely recommend to everyone at LSE.""- Jessica, Grimshaw Club, President 2022/23 ""Being president of Outdoors and Hiking Society these past two years has been a huge privilege. Whilst at times a labour of love, it is something I am extremely passionate about and I hope to have made my mark. I've enjoyed meeting new people, seeing the society grow, and the sense of pride in delivering successful events- culminating in leading a team of 12 for the UK Three Peak sub-24hr Challenge. As I complete my Mountain Leader qualification it has also been an excellent opportunity to develop and put into practice a number of key skills, including leadership, planning, communication and management skills.""- Guido, Outdoor and Hiking Society, President 2021/22 and 2022/23. “Holding a leadership role at one of LSE’s largest societies pushed me out of my comfort zone massively, but was definitely the most rewarding experience of my second year. The people I worked with are now some of my best friends, and I managed to meet some of the most inspiring professionals working in international affairs. It was great to contribute to the LSE community while honing my son skills and making the best memories :) “- Siumi, United Nations Society, Secretary-General for LSEMUN Conference 2023/23 ""Getting involved in LSE societies was the perfect opportunity for me to expand my network & develop my interpersonal skills, here I was interviewing industry-renowned speakers and organizing London-wide events.""- Dean, Business & Investment Group, Head of Corporate Relations 2022/23. ""Being the Social Secretary for the Law Society was hard work but enriching ultimately (and looks decent on the CV too to be fair). I made some friends along the way but also lost a few when they saw the price of Law Ball tickets. I semi-recommend this position.""- Justin, Law Society, Social Secretary 2022/23 ""I applied for vice president of LSESU Outdoors Society as a first year student just a few weeks into LSE with absolutely no knowledge of how a university society operates or what my role would be really be like - I was probably just feeling brave that day! However, I can confidently say that it was one of the best decisions I made during first year. The committee, society members and LSESU made it such a fun experience with a whole year of memories - and skills for the CV :) - that I won't be forgetting anytime soon!""- Bhakti, Outdoor and Hiking Society, Vice President 2022/23.USEFUL RESOURCESRules and Guidance For Candidates)Manifesto GuidanceExplore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:50,f4eba000201b62200cbf5b147547cf5f,Elections,https://www.lsesu.com/communities/hub/elections/

Get in touch.The school is aware of the impact that studying can have on a student and occasionally, there may be a concern that studying is becoming detrimental towards the wellbeing and health of a student.What is the Fitness to Study policy?It may be the case that interrupting studies or finding alternate methods to study are more beneficial for you. The Fitness to Study policy sets out guidance for these situations. This can either be triggered if the students themselves has raised an issue which causes concerns or a staff member notices concerns through the students behaviour or academic performance.There are three different stages to the policy and potential outcomes.Initial or Emerging Concerns which are low level concerns. Students will have an informal meeting within their department to discuss concerns. Common outcomes could include agreeing an Inclusion Plan, signposting to relevant support agencies or agreeing a short break of a couple of weeks.Continuing and/or Moderate Concerns which are for either repeated issues or moderate concerns. The student will meet with a panel comprised of staff from a few different departments. Possible outcomes could include a recommendation of assessment deferral or Interruption of studies, regular appointments with the Student Wellbeing Service or escalating to Stage 3.Severe and/or Enduring Concerns which are concerns which need immediate or emergency intervention. This is again in a panel format and will be convened as swiftly as possible. Potential outcomes could include deferral of assessments, interruption of studies or withdrawal from studies.At any point, the school can decide to temporarily suspend a student if they believe the student poses a serious risk to their own health or that of other students or staff.The important thing to remember is that this procedure is not a punishment in any way, it is a way for LSE to ensure that students are supported and their wellbeing looked after.What can you do?You will be discussing your situation with the school and can feedback to any decisions made throughout the process. If you disagree with decisions made, you can appeal any decisions.You can appeal decisions based on three grounds:New evidence,the outcome being unreasonable or disproportionate,or a procedural flaw which compromised the fairness of the process.For the full guidance, please read the policy.Download the policy(Opens in a new tab)What can we do?Our advisers would be more than happy to attend any panel meetings with you as a silent member.

Look into providing dairy and non-dairy optionsRaise awareness about the current microwave options – maybe the form of a pamphlet in first week – have in bottom floor of SULook into providing more microwaves if SU deem there is adequate demand Make sure the above facilities are available to most students. (For example, facilities in UG common rooms are not available to PG or PHD students.)SHOULD THE LSESU WORK TO INCREASE STUDENT ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL SPACE ON CAMPUS THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ALCOHOL?Proposer: Joshua GoldmanIssue:There is no recreational space on LSE's campus that isn't the bar (the bar is not inclusive to all students) - many other SU provide a space like this (e.g., Coventry SU) By recreational space, we mean a space that isn't necessarily made to study, and where small, recreational activities could be held (e.g., ping pong, pool, PlayStation, boardgames, etc.)This could also be a space to create a community feeling The different common rooms for LSE students vary highly in quality depending on the department / level of study. As a result, LSE students sometimes experience contrasting student life. Solution: Create a recreational space, not limited to a ping pong table and futsal table, that is made accessible and visible to students + good CommsImmediate temporary action: Which rooms are not in use. Can the basement of old building be utilised. Inquire before it becomes something else Should the LSESU work to increase the accessibility of menstrual products in LSE spaces?Proposer: Neha TallaIssue: Limited access to menstrual products on campus for menstruators. When I got my period last on campus I had to ask 3 people to ultimately find out where I could get menstrual products last-minute and it was pretty inconvenient to have to walk around a whole lot to find them finally in the SU building.Solution: It would be really great if we could somehow set up a system where there are menstrual products available for free for menstruators to pick up easily in every LSE building to ease the discomfort of having to go around a bunch in that situation. Ideally, in a similar spot in every building (I.e. ground floor bathroom/reception) so that everyone knows where to get them from. Even if this isn’t possible, more information should be available on the fact that the bathrooms in the SU building first floor have them, because most of the people I spoke to weren’t aware of this either.Provision of menstrual products: LSE should provide menstrual products on every floor of all LSE buildings, including in gender-neutral spaces, to ensure that individuals have easy access to menstrual products. The SU should consider the types of menstrual products available will include tampons, pads, and menstrual cups. Accommodation inclusion: LSE should extend the policy to include all accommodation facilities under its management to ensure individuals have access to menstrual products within their living spacesCreating a welcoming environment: During welcome week, LSESU should inform new students about the menstrual product access policy, where they can find them, and the types of menstrual products availableEnsuring privacy and comfort: LSESU to lobby LSE to recognize that some individuals may not feel comfortable asking for menstrual products and that to address this, LSE should ensure that they are in accessible, private, and safe locationsMonitoring implementation: LSESU should appoint an appropriate person to ensure that the menstrual products are well-stockedCommunication: LSESU should communicate the policy implementation to the student bodySHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY THE LSE TO HAVE STUDENT REPRESENTATION ON THE EXTERNAL FUNDING ETHICAL REVIEW BOARD (EFERB)?Proposer: Maarya Rabbani (Education Officer)Issue: There is currently no student representation on the External Funding Ethical Review Board (EFERB), it solely consists of the School secretary (Louise Nadal) and faculty members from academic departments. Other Committees, Boards, and steering groups at the LSE have at least one student representative in their membership so this case is definitely an outlier for LSE-SU partnership.Solution: The solution is to have at least one currently enrolled student and one Sabbatical Officer on the Board to express student perspective in the discussions ahead of EFERB decisions made re: philanthropic/other gifts that LSE receives.SHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY LSE TO GET WEDNESDAY AFTERNOONS OFF FOR ALL STUDENTS?Proposer: Obaloluwa AgboolaIssue:Postgraduate students are unable to join any LSESU activities on Wednesday afternoonsPostgraduate students are unable to compete in BUCS competition as they are only on Wednesday afternoonsTo some extent, postgraduate students get less exposure to what the LSESU has to offer, which can imply that they would be less likely to participate in wider LSESU events such as elections.Physical exercise is very important for mental health and general health, as a student it is important to have access to SU sport as it is more affordable for studentsSolution: Get LSE to commit to having Wednesday off for all students, including postgraduates. The lobbying action led by the SU should be constructive and acknowledging the different structural challenges that will be faced in achieving this.Examination of options: The LSESU should examine the feasibility of LSE providing Wednesday afternoons off for all students, taking into consideration valid reasons such as tight timetables, and the concerns of part-time students. Protection of mental health: The LSESU should lobby LSE for Wednesday afternoons off for students, highlighting the importance of protecting their mental health. Participation in sports activities should be adopted by LSE as a valid reason for a requested change of timetable as it is essential for students' physical and emotional well-being. Consultation with relevant stakeholders: The LSESU will consult with relevant stakeholders,  to gain their input and support for the proposal. SHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY LSE TO HAVE MANDATORY TRAININGS/WORKSHOPS FOR ALL FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS?Proposer: Luca LoggiaIssue: LSE's stated goal of contributing to the betterment of society is at odds with countervailing dynamics:Its reputation for admitting applicants that are politically exposed persons linked to families with official functions having risks of abusing public for private gain and laundering their proceeds. The admission of such students runs the risk of reputation laundering, whereby potentially corrupt families buy their way into respectability. A lot of the LSE's alumni will go on to pursue high-impact careers - many in notable pursuits, but many others going on to work in industries with a questionable social/environmental footprint.Solution:Introduction of mandatory human rights workshops: The LSESU will lobby LSE to introduce mandatory human rights workshops (10-15 hours) for all first-year students at LSE, including U1 undergraduates and entering MSc students. Incorporation of human rights lens in LSE 2030 Strategy: These mandatory workshops will incorporate a human rights lens in the LSE 2030 Strategy, which identifies the university's priorities in terms of education, research, and employment. By prioritizing human rights training for its students, LSE will ensure that it contributes to creating a more just and equitable world. Importance of human rights training: These mandatory workshops will ensure that LSE students are not part of the problem, but part of the solution, by imparting a human rights lens to students. This training will enable students to pursue high-impact careers with consideration for the human rights considerations underlying their line of work. Enhancing LSE's reputation: These mandatory workshops will further enhance LSE's prestige and reputation by placing it as a leader among universities for prioritizing human rights training among its student body. Defining mandatory and timeframe: LSESU will work with LSE to define what is meant by mandatory and develop a clear timeframe for the delivery of the human rights workshops to ensure that all first-year students complete the training. Voting OutcomesShould the LSESU work to increase student access to hot water and microwaves on campus? PASSEDShould the LSESU work to increase student access to recreational space on campus that doesn't involve alcohol? PASSEDShould the LSESU lobby the LSE to have student representation on the external funding ethical review board (EFERB)?

Proposer: Romane BranthommeIssue:Improving the sport and wellbeing offer at LSE for all LSE studentsMaking sport and wellbeing financially accessible to all LSE studentsSolution:A new sport and wellbeing strategy has been written by current LSESU staff and sabbatical officers that describe ways to fixing those issues. Please see attached SHOULD LSESU HOLD AN LSE SUMMER BALL?Proposer: Emma SomosIssue:There is a lack of unity across the whole of the LSE student body and wider communityThere is a sense of loneliness among LSE studentsThere are few flagship events which are not AU club or department specificFew opportunities for students to meet outside of the lecture room or classroomThere are a lack of events which are attractive to people who don’t drinkThere is a lack of interaction between members across the LSE community (students, staff, faculty and alumni) making it harder for good ideas /information to spreadNotes:Large scale music festivals have been found to intensify existing friendships (Wilks, 2009)Attachment to a place is founded from the social network built at the place (Massey, 1994)The Beaver’s survey on loneliness found that those who felt as though they are involved at some level, attended LSE events, parties and community spaces like LSE LIFEStudent satisfaction has been found to be influenced by social aspects of the university (Universities UK, 2016)Students who enjoyed their experience said it was down to the people they met and the social life. There were no significant differences between institution eyes (NUS & HSBC, 2008)Social interaction are significantly related to the exchange of resources (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998)Solution: Create a flagship LSE Summer Ball open and attractive to all members of the LSE community (students, staff, faculty and alumni)Create a LSE Summer Ball which provides enjoyment for both those who do and do not like to drink through a range of entertainmentEstablish a team of students to organise the ball alongside executive LSESU and LSE staff to provide financial and managerial guidanceThis project would be proposed as a collaboration between all LSE branches (SU, LSE LIFE, LSE Alumni, LSE and more)LSESU acts as a mediator/initiator between all involved partiesThis motion has been written and proposed by William Stein and seconded by Hannah Nairn in December 2018 when it was supported by 450 students. Even though students have expressed tremendous support for an LSE summer ball on numerous occasions, LSE and the LSESU failed students and cancelled the LSE summer ball for 2023. This is particularly frustrating as students have been campaigning for an LSE-wide ball for 5 years now, amassing more than 1750 signatures in support, thus once again, we are submitting a motion for an LSE summer ball.Organisers should prioritise students leaving LSE the year of the ball, including both final year students in undergraduate courses and postgraduate studentsA festival-style setting would be preferred to a formal dinner SHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY LSE TO IMPROVE ITS CHILDCARE OFFER?Proposer: Tilly MasonIssue:LSE used the pandemic as an excuse to shut down its nursery in 2020This not only put student and staff parents in a vulnerable position, but led to the forced redundancy of nursery staff (represented by LSE Unison)Instead, LSE has partnered with 3 private nurseries in the Holborn / Clerkenwell area, offering subsidies for students/staffHowever, research by LSESU this year has shown that these partnered nurseries do not work for the majority of students and staff with childrenBecause more and more students/staff are working from home, they are less likely to travel into campus / central London for the subsidised childcare LSE providesLSE's childcare system is still too expensive for the majority - the cost of living crisis means that it is more important now than ever before to have accessible, affordable childcare provided by LSEWe need LSESU to continue lobbying for LSE to provide bursaries for nurseries!Solution: We need LSE to provide bursaries for nurseries to ensure that students can access affordable childcare local to them!LSESU to conduct more research on what childcare support is required and preferred by LSE students.Responsibility for LSE students with children to be codified into one of the LSESU sabbatical officer roles. SHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY LSE TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO CHAIR SOCIETAL EVENTS WITH A GUEST SPEAKER?Proposer: Dylan SellorsIssue:LSE students are currently not allowed to chair events with a guest speaker.Recently, as president of the PPE society I managed to get the Labour MP and Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry to come in to talk to LSESU PPE and LSESU Labour Society. I would have loved to have been able to chair the event myself, but unfortunately due to current SU policy, this is not permissible. This is particularly frustrating as the University of Oxford and the University of Reading both allowed students to chair a similar event when Emily Thornberry visited them!  UCL also allows their students to chair similar events (such as with Richard Burgon MP). This policy change will vastly benefit LSE students as it will:Allow LSE students to enhance personal skills such as questioning and public speaking.Allow events to be better catered to the interests of the audience.Solution: Allow LSE students to chair events, and choose whether they chair events.Under my proposal the LSESU would still be able to offer guidance and/ or 'strongly recommend' an academic chair but the final say would be with the hosting society. This would allow LSESU societies to rightly enjoy the same benefits that many other students at societies at other universities already enjoy!Any student who wants to act as a chair for a guest speaker must undergo media, moderating & de-escalation training. SHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY THE FAITH CENTRE TO OPEN A NEW PRAYER ROOM FOR MUSLIM WOMEN?Proposer: Salsabel AbuazzaIssue:The current female islamic prayer room is too small. The womens prayer room is much smaller than the male prayer rooms, unfortunately, the womens prayer room is so small that it gets busy and filled up really quickly to the point that during prayer times, many of the female muslim students have to wait outside the prayer room until it empties. This means being late to classes and being unable to pray alongside other students. Moreover, in comparison to UCL and KCL, the LSE prayer rooms are lacking. The LSE prayer rooms do not have any space for contemplation or reading religious texts, which is an important part of our faith. We usually have a 'sisters circle' each week (gathering where we share religious reflections and build community with each other), but we are unable to hold these sister circles in the prayer room as it is too small and we often have to hold these circles in random places on campus, whereas the male students are able to hold their 'brothers circle' in the male prayer room as they have a larger prayer room. Solution: LSESU to lobby the Faith Centre to:Open a new female prayer room on campusEnsure that the new prayer room is large and in a different part of campusEnsure that there is a dedicated area for reading and reflectionEnsure that there is enough space to hold the sisters circles without impacting the use of the space for those praying individuallyWork alongside myself and the islamic society in planning this space and ensuring that it fits the needs of the Muslim women on campusIf a new room is sourced and meets requirements, then the old room should be opened up as an interfaith space SHOULD THE LSESU RESTORE CODIFIED PROVISIONS FOR THE FUNDING OF STUDENT MEDIA GROUPS SUCH AS THE BEAVER? Proposer: Aarti MalhotraIssue: Through this policy proposal, we are attempting to resolve issues related to the funding issues The Beaver has faced over the last year. Due to the removal of the LSESU bye-laws last year, The Beaver has lost access to its annual media grant going forward, which is the primary and critical source of funding for the publication's printing costs. You can read more about the issue and our policy suggestion in the following article: https://thebeaverlse.co.uk/lsesu-defunds-the-beaver-after-74-years/Solution:By codifying and restoring provisions in the LSESU byelaws, the LSESU can guarantee Student Media Group societies a secure source of funding so they can continue their job of keeping the LSE community informed and reporting on meaningful, pressing issues around campus. Codifying provisions for Student Media Group societies’ funding will benefit both the societies and wider student community, who rely on the Student Media Group societies as essential sources of information. Voting OutcomesShould the LSESU lobby LSE to work with the LSESU on implementing a new sport and wellbeing strategy? PASSEDShould LSESU hold an LSE Summer Ball?

This could be provided by the SU or the LSE but should be advertised and visible to the campus community.The LGBTQ+ Centre on campus should have gender neutral bathrooms, changing areas, and a shower.The LGBTQ+ Centre should offer, in conjunction with the SU, LGBTQ+ Society and Spectrum, event opportunities such as career networking, peer support, sober mixers, game nights, coffee chats, drag nights, fundraisers, and a trans support circle.The LGBTQ+ Centre should also offer a safe space to sign post for LGBTQ+ community resources, have a free wardrobe/ clothing exchange, and space to take free safer sex supplies and exchange/donate gender affirming supplies to peers like old binders, trans tape, prosthetic glue or post op supplies. Increased funding to the LGBTQ+ Society and Spectrum in this LGBTQ+ space to provide food, coffee, and items such as sensory items, beanbag chairs, places to study and do work during designated quiet parts of the center or drop in times. SHOULD THE LSESU LOBBY LSE TO IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATE AND IMPLEMENT TANGIBLE ACTION TO IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK STUDENTS, TACKLE RACISM BOTH ON AND OUTSIDE CAMPUS AND HAVE A WORKING EXPANSIVE EDI TEAM?Proposer: Sarah OnifadeIssue:LSE has continually failed its black students. https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/education/Assets/ Documents/ Inclusive-Education-Action-Plan-2019/BAME-Student-Experiences-at-LSE.pdfYear after Year there have been attainment inequalities in which LSE has not tackled adequately https:// www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Undergraduate/Prospective-Students/OfS-Transparency-ReturnLSE has not done enough to provide institutional support for its black students despite promising to do so in the wake of George Floyd murder. Additionally they have not held themselves accountable for its racial equity goals https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/equity-diversity-and-inclusion/EDI-at-LSE/ Race-Equity- at-LSE/race-equity-framework/Race-Equity-FrameworkLSE race equity framework has been made redundant with both the social media and real-life present being non-existent with the last update to the social media page being in 2021. LSE EDI twitter page has not tweeted anything since 2021 https://twitter.com/EDI_LSELSE has perpetuated a culture in which black students depend on external organisations and other students to support their wellbeing and academic studies. In a google form conducted by me over 70% of responses felt that LSE did not support their wellbeing, with only 10% feeling LSE did. This poll was aimed at the Afro Caribbean society at the LSESU.These are issues that are well known within the black community at LSE. However, there is a lack of formal recognition and accountability from LSE themselves. They have made data obscure by making their EDI and student population data report to just white and BAME students. https://info.lse.ac.uk/ staff/divisions/ equity-diversity-and-inclusion/Assets/Documents/PDFs/Public-Sector-Equality-Duty- report- for-2019-20.pdfSolution: To lobby LSE to implement the following:LSE must explicitly make sure that prospective and current students know that LSE has a zero- tolerance policy towards any racismLSE must make sure that subwardens and wardens promote an anti-racist culture. They must add a racism and microaggression section to the halls code of conductLSE must make sure that there is guaranteed institutional funding for racial based wellbeing workshops LSE must start and implement a racism and discrimination workshop mandatory to both student and staff in the next 2 academic yearsLSE must completely restructure its EDI team and make sure that the student body has full transparency towards its reformationLSE must not use BAME in any student data and show student data by ethnic group as per pre-2018 LSE must hire a black student staff lead like SOASLSE should introduce pre-course icebreakers to break down ethnic barriersLSE should provide more information and transparency on complaint procedures and actions taken regarding racism at LSELSESU should explore the option of implementing anti-racism workshops for studentsSHOULD LSESU LOBBY THE LSE TO IMPLEMENT INCLUSIVE TOILET/ WASHROOM FACILITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS?Proposer: Mallika KumarIssue:Almost every LSE building's bathroom only has toilet paperStudent Union building used to have one washroom with jet spray, but that particular stall has become temporarily unavailableWhile there is diversity in LSE cafes, canteens and food items for international cuisines, there is not cultural diversity in bathroom facilitiesInternational students have to spend extra money to purchase electronic portable bidetsSolution: To lobby LSE to install at least one jet-spray/connected bidet, accounting for gender segregated bathrooms, in each LSE building including halls of accommodation and new buildings. With accessible signage and appropriate communication to the student body. SHOULD THE LSESU CAMPAIGN FOR LSE TO IMPROVE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR DISABLED AND NEURODIVERGENT STUDENTS?Proposer: Luca LoggiaIssue: Disabled and Neurodivergent students have experienced difficulties in engaging, and receiving satisfactory support from, the university’s Disability and Wellbeing Service (DWS).Student’s My Adjustment Plans, that outline Reasonable Adjustments to the teaching, learning and assessment to which a Disabled and/or Neurodivergent student should receive, are often non-tailored to a student’s specific needs, and receive inconsistent levels of adoption across the school.Disabled and Neurodivergent students experience challenges with participation within the wider school community, in part, due to a systemic lack of understanding by other Students and Staff on how to appropriately accommodate them.Solution:LSESU should campaign to the university’s Student Wellbeing division (SWS), which operates the Disability and Wellbeing Service (DWS), to implement effective avenues for students to provide honest feedback on their experience with the service. This should include continuing current efforts to establish a Student Service Users Group.LSESU should campaign to LSE, to ensure that Reasonable Adjustments that are provided to Disabled and Neurodivergent Students and Staff, are beneficial to their individual accessibility needs; with effective strategies agreed to ensure school-wide compliance with these required adjustments.LSESU should improve available resources, including training, to promote a broader understanding and accommodation of Disabled and Neurodivergent members, to its wider membership base. It should be campaigned for similar resources to be provided by LSE.LSESU should lobby LSE to:Ensure that student stakeholders are involved and heard in decision-making at the EDI team. Ensure that there is greater communication about resources available to ensure student accessibilityVoting OutcomesShould the LSESU lobby LSE to create an extenuating circumstance specifically regarding menstrual pain and period conditions? PASSEDShould the LSESU work to make availability of free drinks covers and stoppers mandatory at all on and off campus events run by the SU and LSE?

Get in touch.Not everything will go to plan. There will be times when things just aren’t working and you want to escalate them.What can you do?The School Complaints procedure is a policy which encompasses anything which is “an expression of dissatisfaction by one or more students about an academic or administrative service or facility” during your time at LSE. This could include unhappiness with the standard of teaching, instances of bias or prejudices from academics to much more.Please note: you cannot make a formal complaint about your individual grades through this process. This should be done via the appeals process.The Complaints procedure is a two-stage procedure.Stage one: informal complaintFirst, an informal complaint should be raised, i.e. speaking to your department or the individual involved with the view to resolving the issue.Stage two: formal complaintAfter the informal stage, if you are still unhappy with the situation then a formal complaint can be submitted. This is where you can pursue the complaint with the School Secretary and it will be assessed by people independent of your situation. One important thing to note is for a complaint to be successful, there will generally need to be evidence to support it. It would be a good idea to have a think about if there is anything you can provide in support of your complaint, such as email communications. You can pursue the complaint alone or in a group. You can also skip straight to this formal complaint stage, if you do not feel it was appropriate to approach the individual involved via the informal route.OutcomeFinally, all complaints need an outcome. It is not enough to just raise the complaint, an outcome should also be requested. This could either be a resolution for yourself or something which will stop the issue arising in the future. The complaints form can be found at the bottom of the guidance policy.LSE Complaints Policy(Opens in a new tab)What can we do?Our advisers are more than happy to look over any draft complaint forms before you send them or provide you advice on the process if there are elements you would like further clarification on.Where to find usSaw Swee Hock Student CentreContact ussu.advice@lse.ac.uk020 7955 7158Booking appointmentsYou can book an appointment via emailsu.advice@lse.ac.ukExplore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:52,64d1b25e5feb9c4cf9340cb46eb82908,Complaints,https://www.lsesu.com/support/advice/studying/complaints/

Get in touch.If you feel as though your performance in an assessment has been negatively impact by factors outside of your control, you should consider the Exceptional Circumstances (EC) procedure.What can you do?The Exceptional Circumstances procedure allows you to make the Exam Board aware of your situation and take it into account when it comes to your final classification. They will also consider if it was appropriate for you to complete the assessment in the first place.A key thing to be aware of is that the school operates a “fit to sit” policy, which means that by taking an assessment, you are declaring yourself fit and able to do so. This is the single main reason why most EC applications are rejected and is worth addressing in your form. If you are aware of the issues in advance of the exam, the school suggests that you should first seek an Extension and if that is not accepted or possible, look at Deferring the assessment. Ignorance of these procedures is not a reason that the School will accept for non-engagement with them.How to applyTo declare your circumstances you need to complete an Exceptional Circumstances Form and submit this along with evidence that follows LSE's Standards of Evidence(Opens in a new tab). You should read the LSE Guidance fully before doing so.POSSIBLE OUTCOMESIf accepted, ECs may be able to:Discount a failed/absent attempt (treating that attempt as if it was a deferral)Grant additional attempts where the maximum two attempts to pass a course have been exhaustedRemove late penalties that were applied due to late submissionAward a higher degree classification, if you have a borderline mark profile as defined by the General Proviso in the Classification Scheme for your programme.ECs cannot:Individual marks can never be changed as a result of the submission of Exceptional Circumstances (ECs). However, ECs may result in the lifting of a penalty where late submission penalties have been applied, see above. It is not possible to discount a course or assessment that you pass even if you feel you have underperformed.DEADLINES ARE AVAILABLE ON THE lSE WEBPAGEWhat can we do?Our advisers can provide you guidance on the process and procedure itself as well as looking over the form itself before you submit it.

Get in touch.Results Day can provoke very mixed reactions! It can either be a cause for joy and celebration or an unpleasant surprise. If you feel as though the grade received is not indicative of your work, you may want to consider submitting an appeal.What can you do?We have outlined the process for you below – it is very important to familiarise yourself thoroughly with the regulations, especially if you intend to proceed with an appeal. Remember, you can only appeal your final grades, not your provisional results. We recommend students visit the LSE website for full, comprehensive information on the Appeals process. We have also highlighted here common areas which students request Advice for. This includes the most common reasons for appeals being rejected.The processIn essence there are two grounds on which you can appeal:Procedural Error New Information about Exceptional Circumstances (ECs) You can appeal under either (or both) and you do have a deadline to submit your completed form, along with any relevant evidence.The deadline is generally 10 working days following the release of your results. Deadlines can be found on the LSE website. If you think you might struggle to meet this deadline and have a good reason, we would encourage you to contact the Student  Regulations Team (SRT) ASAP, and certainly before the deadline. They may be able to provide you with an extension.Our advisers can look over a copy of your form before you submit it. You must ensure you provide advisers with sufficient time to do this, for example, at least 3 working days. Please note Advisers will not write statements or submissions for students.If your appeal is unsuccessful, you will have the option of entering Stage 2 of the appeals process. Further information about the Stage 2 process will be provided when you recieve your Stage 1 outcome. If you wish to read more about Stage 2, you can find this on the LSE website.Common reasons that appeals are unsucessful:The appeal was received outside the deadline of 10 working days without good reason and evidence for the delay. In cases where a delay is unavoidable, the appeal must be submitted as soon as possible after the deadline and must include an explanation and independent supporting evidence covering the entire period affected.The Exceptional Circumstances could, in the opinion of the ART, have been disclosed via the Exceptional Circumstances procedure; i.e. in time for consideration by the Sub-Board of Examiners for your programme.The appeal is made on the grounds of Exceptional Circumstances, but the evidence does not meet the criteria set down in the School’s ‘Standards of Evidence’.Although frequently cited in appeal applications, the following do not constitute valid grounds for appeal:Disagreement with the academic judgement of a Sub-Board/Board in assessing the merits of an item of academic work or the classification of a final award, where the Board’s decision was reached in accordance with the School’s regulations and procedures. In such circumstances you should request feedback from the relevant course tutor;Ignorance without good reason of the published regulations and procedures, including deadlines for submitting Exceptional Circumstances or Deferral requests;Academic performance being affected by alleged poor teaching, supervision or guidance. In such circumstances you should submit a complaint in good time in accordance with the Complaints Procedure. Ground one: procedural error The first ground under which you can appeal (under stage 1) is a ‘procedural error.’The School describes this as an instance where “the Exam Board did not follow the correct procedure such that there is reasonable doubt that the decision would have been the same if the correct procedure had been followed.”This can encompass anything from an administrative mistake to a wider procedural irregularity. This basically means that something happened after you submitted your assessment that shouldn’t have happened. It might be that your classification was incorrectly calculated because some completed modules were omitted, for example, or perhaps you had a successful EC claim, but the Exam Board didn’t consider it. Or it could be any other error which occurred at the School level after you clicked ‘submit’. Ground two: new information about Exceptional Circumstances ECs are classified as circumstances which “would normally be sudden, unforeseen, out of the student’s control and proximate to the assessment(s) in question.”As this deadline has now passed, if you feel you have valid ECs, you would now need to raise it via an appeal. However, you would need to:Explain and evidence the ECs that affected the assessment in questionProvide a good reason (with evidence) for not submitting an EC application at the timeThe Standards of Evidence document outlines the kind of evidence the School would expect to see under different scenarios.It is important to note that LSE operates a “Fit to Sit/Submit” policy. In effect this means that once you enter an exam room (or once you accept/commence an online assessment) you are deeming yourself fit enough to undertake the assessment in question.The reason it is necessary to highlight this is because the School would expect students who were not fit enough to take their assessments to have either deferred them or to have sought an extension. Any successful appeal under the EC grounds will need to provide a good reason why these options weren’t explored at the time (particularly the deferral). There may well be strong reasons (for example, linked to mental or physical ill health) why you didn’t, but you will need to provide evidence.There are two final points to be made about appeals based on ECs.The first is that you can only appeal:Your final degree classificationNot being awarded a degree, or a decision to class you as a “Final Fail”A mark or grade of “Absent,” “Incomplete” or “Fail”The second is that for final degree classification appeals, your marks must be borderline. More specifically, you need to meet the following conditions:Your classification marks are no more than three marks below the next higher classification in a single course, and/or:Your aggregate is no more than fifteen marks away as an Undergraduate, or ten marks as a Postgraduate, from the next higher classification on aggregateIf your appeal is based on new information about ECs, and doesn’t satisfy the above criteria, it is highly likely that your appeal will be unsuccessful. What you can't appeal You cannot appeal just because you disagree with your results. One of the most common reasons for appeals being rejected is because they are deemed to be questioning “academic judgement.” You also cannot appeal on the grounds of perceived poor quality teaching or course running – this is the matter for the Complaints Procedure.The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA), a body which performs an ombudsman-like function for the HE sector (and to whom you can complain if you remain dissatisfied after progressing through both appeal stages) describes academic judgement as “a judgment that is made about a matter where only the opinion of an academic expert is sufficient.”What can we do?Our advisers are more than happy to look over any forms before you submit them or provide you guidance on the process if there is anything you do not understand or would like clarity on.

Get in touch.As an academic institution, LSE takes Academic Misconduct seriously. This includes plagiarism, collusion and exam offences. We have outlined the process below as well as our suggestions for what you can do if you are accused of Academic Misconduct.What happens if you are contacted by lse about possible academic misconduct?Generally the department will contact you via email explaining their concern and proposing some next steps. Remember, at this stage, the department will be seeking a conversation with you to determine what may have occurred. You will have the opportunity to respond either via an email or a face-to-face meeting (online or in-person). Please contact us if you would like support with this.If, after your response, the department determines that an Academic Misconduct offence has occurred, they will email you with a decision. You can either accept this penalty or appeal it via an Academic Misconduct Panel.OutcomesPossible outcomes could include a dismissal of the case, formal warning, re-mark the work with the plagiarised material removed, a zero mark for the paper or more severe sanctions.PlagiarismAn important thing to be aware of is that accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. The school will look solely at the words on the page when making these determinations. Your circumstances will be taken into account when deciding on a penalty however.Full information on the process can be found here. What can you do?There are a few ways that you can prepare for both the allegation email/meeting or Academic Misconduct Panel. You will usually be asked what you understand about plagiarism or academic integrity as well as being asked how you usually take notes and reference. You may also be asked about the content of the work to ensure that you have an understanding of it. It would be a good idea to familiarise yourself with your work to make sure you can answer these questions, it might be a while since you last looked at the work!In the case of suspected use of AI, we understand that this may be difficult to work through. Please contact us if you have further questions about this (su.advice@lse.ac.uk). If at any stage you would like some support, please do reach out to our advisers in the Advice Service.If you would like to speak to someone about referencing to ensure that you are doing things correctly, we would suggest contacting LSE Life as they provide workshops and one-on-one study sessions covering a range of study skills.What can we do?Our advisers can attend departmental or panel meeting with you as a silent attendee. We can also provide you advice and guidance on the process itself along with answering any questions you may have about the procedure.Please note, unfortunately we are not able to predict the outcome of an Academic Misconduct investigation at any stage.

However, there are certain things to be aware of before you decide to leave early.What can you do?The most important thing to be aware of is that your tenancy agreement or housing contract is a legally binding document. This means you have to stick to the terms of it and are legally liable to pay the rent for the time agreed.Some contracts will have what is known as a “break clause” in them, which will allow you to leave your contract early. Usually these will allow you to terminate your contract after 6 months of being there but may also have additional conditions attached such as a notice period. This may also be called an “early termination” clause.You may be able to speak to the landlord and come to an agreement that if you find a replacement tenant, you will be able to leave the contract – this can be a fairly common compromise.It is definitely worth being sure of your contract and your rights about leaving early before signing a new agreement as you may find yourself liable for 2 rents – you definitely want to avoid this!For more information, please see the Shelter website. Shelter is the UK's leading specialist housing advice charity. For specialist legal advice you can also contact the University of London Housing Service who offer free consultations for LSE students or your local Citizens Advice centre.What can we do?If you are unsure about the practicalities of your contract or rights around moving out, please do get in touch and one of our advisors will be happy to provide you guidance on this.Where to find usSaw Swee Hock Student CentreContact ussu.advice@lse.ac.uk020 7955 7158Booking appointmentsYou can book an appointment via emailsu.advice@lse.ac.ukExplore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:53,10502ad167fde4f7426507f606330fa9,Moving Out,https://www.lsesu.com/support/advice/housing/moving-out/

Getting your full deposit back can be the difficult part as landlords will often look for reasons to make deductions for arrears or damage to the property.What can you do?If you are having difficulties getting the landlord to return your deposit, or you do not agree with the deductions, there are a couple of options for you.The majority of housing agreements are what are called Assured Shorthold Tenancies. Under these tenancies, your deposit has to be protected in a government scheme and this will be directly mentioned in your housing agreement. Each of these schemes have a dispute resolution service where you can submit a form detailing your dispute.You will also need to submit relevant evidence – this could be communication between you and the landlord or photographs of the property. These schemes will look at the situation and return the deposit amount they feel is fair. It is always worth speaking to your landlord before you go down this route as they may try to resolve the situation before this formal process.The housing charity Shelter has a useful advice page on getting your deposit back which covers this in more detail.Shelter Deposit Advice(Opens in a new tab)What can we do?If you have any questions about deposits, please feel free to get in touch with us using the details below.Where to find usSaw Swee Hock Student CentreContact ussu.advice@lse.ac.uk020 7955 7158Booking appointmentsYou can book an appointment via emailsu.advice@lse.ac.ukExplore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:53,0a171516e57e5dcd912ad368940d43d8,Deposits,https://www.lsesu.com/support/advice/housing/deposits/

The Eden Centre can be contacted via email at eden@lse.ac.uk. Introduced by Kerry Vandersteen, Learning Technologist. YuJa Panorama - A plug-in for Moodle that allows you to convert content into alternative formats. It’s built into Moodle, so you don’t have to install or download it. You can simply click on the little person-shaped icon that appears next to the linked material on a given Moodle page, and you can convert the material into a text file, audio podcast, braille, or something else, depending on the original format. THE LIBRARYThe Library has specific services and facilities to make it more inclusive and accessible to disabled and neurodivergent students. They have a massive collection to borrow from, including e-resources and archive collections, and many materials can be accessed in alternative formats. If you have a registered disability, the loan period you are allowed to borrow materials can be increased from the standard 7 days to 1-2 weeks, and your borrowing entitlements can also be increased from 30 items at a time to 60. If you require any of these adjustments, you should speak to a staff member at the Library. The Library also has accessible spaces equipped with assistive technology that you can book and use, including study rooms, desks and PCs, and library staff are also happy to physically help you fetch materials if needed. You can also request to have a personal locker at the Library, where you can keep materials or equipment. Finally, the Library has a buddy-system, where disabled and neurodivergent students can be paired with a member of the Library staff who will be a permanent point of contact, assist with any questions and offer support. If you would like to discuss any of these services or have any other questions, you can contact the Library via email at library.disability.assistance@lse.ac.uk, or contact the Services Manager at jo.taplin-green@lse.ac.uk.Introduced by Joanne Taplin-Green, Library Readers’ Services Manager.Library Support for Disabled Students - Everything you need to know about using the Library as a disabled or neurodivergent student, including information on the above-mentioned services and facilities, and contact information.Information on physical accessibility of the Library LSE LIFELSE LIFE run the Neurodivergent Student Academic Mentoring (ND SAM) programme, where experienced LSE students who self-identify as neurodivergent mentor new LSE students who also self-identify as neurodivergent.

Get in touch.If you want to check if there have been any administrative errors in between your work being marked and the grade being given to you, you can apply for an Administrative Mark Check.At LSE, there is no provision for an exam script or coursework to be re-marked once the final mark has been confirmed by an external examiner. However, although the academic judgement of the internal and external examiners cannot be called into question, the School does permit students to request an administrative mark check in certain specific circumstances.This check verifies that the published final mark on LSE for You corresponds to the mark you were awarded by the relevant academic department. It does not constitute a re-marking of the work.What can you do?Administrative mark checks are only available for ratified final results that are either:Failed coursesPassed courses with borderline marksPassed components with borderline marks'Borderline' is defined as where your mark is no more than 3 marks away from the next higher classification boundary in a single course.Mark checks are not available for provisional January results or 12 month PG results prior to ratification. Mark checks are not available for marks released in previous academic years.Further details on the administrative mark check can be found on the LSE website.

Get in touch.Your landlord is responsible for ensuring your property is fit to live in. The more serious the problem, the quicker the repairs need to be. This can be frustrating, as smaller issues can take a long time to resolve.What can you do?It can be tempting to threaten to withhold rent as a way of forcing your landlord or property agent to carry out the repairs, but we do not recommend doing this. Your duty to pay rent is separate to their duty to carry out repairs. By not paying rent, you are leaving yourself open to being evicted.We would suggest keeping in constant contact with the landlord and keep reminding them that the work still has not been carried out. We would also suggest making sure you take photographs of the problem and ensuring that all communication you have with the landlord or agent is written down. If the repairs continue to not be fixed, it is worth finding the relevant formal complaints procedure and submitting a complaint.For more detailed information, see the Shelter guide to landlords and repairs.Where to find usSaw Swee Hock Student CentreContact ussu.advice@lse.ac.uk020 7955 7158Booking appointmentsYou can book an appointment via emailsu.advice@lse.ac.ukExplore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:53,3df7c7cb30b0677a9072b113a469c604,Landlord Problems,https://www.lsesu.com/support/advice/housing/landlords/

To help us do this, we launched Consent.Ed. What is Consent.Ed?  Consent.Ed is a three-part educational programme developed by LSE and LSE Student’s Union to explore issues around sexual consent, providing an opportunity for us to discuss how we can look out for one another and create a positive, respectful consent culture, where everyone feels safe on campus. We recognise the sensitivity of the topic and have chosen the content we cover carefully. We’ve worked hard to make sure the course is as informative, and inclusive as possible. It is expected of you and everyone in the LSE community to take part in Consent.Ed. Consent.Ed Attendance  We all benefit from learning more about what it means to seek and give consent, as well as how to safely intervene when you witness a situation that is not quite right. The sessions will empower you to become an active bystander and make positive decisions about your own relationships and interactions with others.  Level 1 and Level 2 should be completed by all new students here at LSE. Level 3 is for Student Union clubs and societies committee members.   Content Warning: Both the online and in-person course materials for Consent.Ed discuss topics of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and rape. We recognise the sensitive nature of Consent.Ed and students who feel unable to participate for personal reasons can opt out. Please note that we will also hold survivors-only sessions for level 2 Consent.Ed which you can find details of below. Next Steps Step 1: Complete your online training Level 1 of Consent.Ed is completion of the online training module as a pre-enrollment expectation. The training takes approximately 30 minutes, but you can complete this at your own pace.  Complete your Consent.Ed training (lse.ac.uk) Step 2: Booking your In-Person Workshop  Level 2 of Consent.Ed is completion of the in-person workshop which will be led by either LSE student facilitators or LSE/LSESU staff members who are trained to facilitate discussion in a safe environment. This training takes 90 minutes and will be included in your departmental induction timetable. We will also be offering survivor-only workshops. Alternatively, you can also opt-out entirely by filling out the linked form below. Survivor-Only Workshops and Opting Out As we recognise the sensitive nature of Consent.Ed, we will be offering survivor-only workshops, to create a carefully tailored space for discussion. These workshops are led by survivors and experts from an external organisation called Not The Only One. Not The Only One is a unique initiative for students who have experienced sexual violence at any point in their life, including child sexual abuse. Their work is unambiguously survivor-led and co-developed with students at a range of universities. The survivor consent workshops are open only to students who have experienced some form of sexual violence / abuse. This could have been non-physical, a one-time experience, a long time ago - or something that has happened in different ways at different times. All genders and sexualities are welcome. The workshops provide a space to learn about and discuss consent in a trauma-informed manner together with other survivors. Each workshop is a survivor only space run in a small group and facilitated by two members of Not The Only One. They will not ask you to discuss your experience(s). For students who wish to Opt Out, or sign up for more information on the Survivor Only Workshop, fill out the form attached here: Opt-Out and Survivor workshop info    Step 3: Active Bystander Training Part 3 of Consent.Ed is for LSE Student Union clubs and societies committee members. Committee members will need to complete Level 3 Consent.Ed which is an ‘Active Bystander’ course facilitated by Student Union staff. For more information on this please do contact the SU: su.consent@lse.ac.uk. Support or Questions/Concerns?  We understand that you may have concerns about the sensitive nature of Consent.Ed. We've designed the online course and the in-person sessions to be empowering, and we've tried to be sensitive about the content. You do not have to participate in this course should you feel unable to do so and you can opt out altogether by filling out the opt out form linked above.  We encourage anyone concerned about the content or attending Consent.Ed to email us, or if you have any questions at all, please reach out to su.consent@lse.ac.uk You can also always access support by following this link- Support for students (lse.ac.uk)  Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:53,ed538ce92f94c92006904c35666db627,Consent Ed,https://www.lsesu.com/support/consented/

To do this, you can set up QR codes that link to a charity's website, or to a JustGiving page.If you have any costs associated with fundraising, these unfortunately can not be reimbursed from your society account due to Charity Law. The SU does not have any card readers that they're able to lend to societies, and we're unable to process any cash.The charity that you raise money for must have a UK Registered Charity Number with the Charity Commission.If you do wish to fundraise, please contact su.societies@lse.ac.uk so that we can support you from the start!Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:54,af85b4d6b466181e7c449a83869c95d0,Fundraising,https://www.lsesu.com/communities/hub/finances/fundraising/

It can affect anyone regardless of age, class, race, gender, sexuality, disability or social background. According to Safe Lives, the majority of high-risk victims are in their 20s or 30s, with those under 25 most likely to suffer interpersonal violence.Many people hold the abuse a secret, however, domestic abuse is rarely a one-off event and often gets more severe and more frequent over time.Do not feel guilty or blame yourself. Domestic abuse is never the fault of the person who is experiencing it.There is a range of services available to you, and there are many people and organisations that are able to support you if you are experiencing domestic abuse.What are the signs of domestic abuse?Domestic abuse is not only physical, but can also be verbal, psychological and emotional, sexual, coercive, financial and economic as well as technological.You could be experiencing domestic abuse if someone you live with:Physically harms you or denies access to doctors or medication.Is jealous and possessive and directs false allegations towards you.Acts charming one minute and abusive the next.Controls where you go, who you can meet, and what you can do.Isolates you from your friends and relatives.Constantly puts you down and humiliates you.Controls your money.Gaslights you and says they are not abusing you even if their behaviour indicates they are.Pressures you into having unwanted sex.Monitors or tracks your movements or messages, threatens to reveal unwanted information on social media.Uses anger and intimidation to control you.This is not an exhaustive list. Information from Refuge: https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/en/What-is-abuseDeveloping a crisis planPlan in advance how you might respond to different crisis situations.Think through options available to you.Keep emergency and support telephone numbers with you.Teach your kids to call 999 in an emergency.If you have someone you trust, tell them what is going on.Rehearse an escape plan.Keep spare keys, money and a set of clothes and any medication you use at hand.Know where the nearest phone is, and if you have a mobile phone, try to keep it with you.If you think they may attack you, move to the room that has a route out, and try to stay away from rooms in which you may be easily trapped.If possible, leave when the abuser is not around but be prepared to leave in an emergency.Information from Women’s Aid.

You may also be able to secure sponsorship for non-monetary items such as food and drink for social events or tickets to attend conferences and events for your members.Our student groups are sector leading in the amount of income they generate through sponsorship. Creating partnerships with external organisations can help you secure the funding or resources you need to be able to deliver all of your big ideas or activities. This page outlines some of the important things to think about as well as the steps you need to take to arrange a contract and get it signed by the Students' Union.Step 1: Plan, prepare, approachFor any committee members who are leading on securing sponsorship we have created a helpful training module on how to successfully negotiate your sponsorship. Once you have completed this you need to create a plan of who you are going to appraoch, what you are going to ask them for and how you are going negoitate that with them.Sponsorship PacksA Sponsorship Pack can be given to companies to include more information about your club/societies and what you want from the deal. Having a professional looking offer and visual takeaway for the sponsor can sometimes be the difference between closing a pitch or losing the company so get prepared. There is a rough guideline below of what to include in your pack:What your club/society is about and what you do (include detailed figures)What the company would gain from sponsorship of your club/society (publicity, reaching to a student audience or potentially thousand etc.). Targeting students is part of many companies’ promotion strategies.What would you like from the company (workshop, space, or do you need money or catering for an event or new hoodies for the year etc.)If you are asking for money, how much will it cost the company? - don’t be unrealistic, expect to have to negotiate. Make sure you know what other clubs/societies similar to you have secured to give you an idea of what you are worth as a club/society.Your contact detailsI have a question about sponsorship or contracts, who do I contact?To discuss any sponsorship questions please contact the Team managers by emailing su.activities@lse.ac.ukAre there any companies that we are not allowed to partner with?The Union currently does not have a veto list of specific companies you cannot partner with but we do have policies which mean you cannot make partnerships with certain types of companies.These include: LSESU cannot make any future affiliations with fossil fuel or armaments companies, in order to uphold the SU’s commitment to climate justice.If a group submits a contract for a fossil fuel or armament company, the Union will not sign the contract.Our Sponsor would like to use their own contract template is this ok?Sometimes this is ok, but to ensure you are not rejected after lots of negotiation and work, ask the company for a copy of the template contract. Then get in contact with one of the team managers with a copy of their contract, to check the template before moving forward.Who can we partner with?Identify companies/brands that have the similar values/objectives as your event or club/society or committee.Consider any national governing bodies or organisations who are linked to your club/society.For departmental societies consider which graduate recruiters would be keen to target your area.Consider what qualities your club/society or committee members have that graduate recruiters may look for (e.g. leadership skills).Research companies to see if they are involved in or support your activity such as drama or chess etc.Step 2: Agree & Sign the ContractIf a company has agreed to sponsors you, you must then draw up the agreement between yourselves (the club/society) and your sponsors. This agreement will consist of everything that the organisation is giving you and what you are promising the organisation in return.We have created a contract template that all societies should be using for contracts.(Please note that there are several points in there, particularly around data protection, marketing and promoting events and booking rooms on campus that should not be removed or amended. If you remove or amend these so that their purpose is no longer clear within the contract, you will be asked to resubmit the contract with the original phrases in.)Please get the organisation to sign the contract, but do not sign it yourself. The Students' Union will sign all contracts on your behalf – no matter how big or small the amount is or whether the contract is with a foreign organisation. Contracts signed by the sponsor and someone that isn’t from the Students’ Union will not be valid and we will not be able to issue an invoice for you to receive and sponsorship into your account.Step 3: Submit your contract for reviewPlease submit your contrat for review using the contract submission form. Submit Your Sponsorship Contract HereIf your sponsor or your committee have any special requires that go along side the contract, please add them to the notes and requests sections of the form. We aim to review contracts twice per week (During term time it may be less frequent due to the high volume of contracts submitted by student groups).If there is an issue with your contract the staff team will contact with actions you need to do to rectify the issue. If the contract is approved, you will recieve an approval email and a copy of the signed contract. It is then your responsibility to share this with your sponsor.Step 4: Union sends an InvoiceOnce your contract is approved, the Union Finance Team will raise an invoice and send it to your sponsor with a 30 day period for payment. To check if a sponsors has paid, please check your student group account via the expense365 or your treasurer. If your sponsorship money hasn't come through after the 30 day payment period, the LSESU Finance Team will send out a standard email to chase unpaid invoices once per term, other than this it is your Society's responsibility to chase your sponsors for payments. If at the end of June we still haven't received payment from your sponsor, we will write off any unpaid invoices.  Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:55,cf4df10fff0f2645b1c7b7e1cdfb0794,Sponsorship,https://www.lsesu.com/communities/hub/finances/sponsorship/

"	Assessment Regulations Review Skip to content  Sabbatical Officer and PTO projects Assessment Regulations ReviewAssessment Regulations ReviewAs a Union we are committed to lobbying LSE's academic assessment regulations. We aim to question whether their implementation impacts all students equally and whether, when combined with the School’s academic standards, they are contributing to poor student satisfaction and wellbeing.2020/21In 2020/21, sabbatical officers Bali Birch-Lee, Laura Goddard, and Morgan Fairless conducted a review of LSE's current assessment regulations and created a set of recommended changes. This is because LSE’s current assessment regulations and how they are applied are quite draconian in comparison with most other universities. In turn, they create a negative experience for many students because they exacerbate inequalities and poor mental health within our student community. The LSESU’s goal is to lobby the school to make their assessment regulations fairer and more empathetic towards students. We identified seven academic regulations which require reviewing: Exceptional Circumstances Fit to SitAppealsAcademic MisconductExtensions Late SubmissionsEvidence RequirementsWhilst these policies have been examined in turn, it is important to note that students will rarely have interacted with only one of these policies and that they often interact during a student’s academic journey. OBJECTIVESUndertake a review of LSE's assessment regulationsCreate a report with recommendationsLobby LSE to commit to reforming the assessment regulations in line with our recommendationsTHE REPORTOn 1 April 2021, we released the Assessment Regulations Report. You can find links to both the full report and to the executive summary for students below:Full ReportExecutive Summary2022/23A year on from the publication of the report, the LSESU is now seeking the input of all LSE stakeholders — from students to staff. We will continue to lobby the school to push LSE into making their assessment regulations fairer for students.We are currently focusing on reforming the Resit Deferred Assessment Period (RDAP) with the aim to change the current policy that stipulates postgrads cannot resit exams during the school year and must wait until the following January. We will do this through a hybrid approach (report and campaign). Submit your testimonies here. GET SUPPORTIf you are a current student who would like to speak to someone about any of these regulations in relation to your current assessments or studies, our Advice Team can offer free, impartial and confidential advice and support.

Our Clubs and Societies deliver over 2000 events every year for their members. As a registered LSESU Club or Society, event organisers within groups must complete an event proposal form for every planned event!It is a legal requirement to have all activities recorded and risk assessed, but knowing what groups want to do also allows our staff team to offer you advice and support! Submit your event form below:The Clubs and Societies Team will do their best to reach your event form as quickly as possible, usually within five business days.Regular Event Form (for 2023/24)Event form for LSESU Clubs and Societies to propose small or regular events. For example, the form should be used for: - Society meetings- Picnics- Film screenings- Rehearsals- Pub quizzes- Restaurant visits- Any similar small scale events etc. This form is NOT for any event that:- Has external speakers- Is considered a flagship- Has a budget of over £500 or a large proportion of your group's balance- Has more than 75 attendees- Is being organised alongside an external organisation- Is centred around alcohol consumption (eg. club nights, wine tasting etc.)For any of the events listed above, please complete the 'Large Events Form'. SUBMIT HERELarge Event or Speaker Event Form (for 2023/24)This is for higher-risk and logistically larger events such as:- External speaker events- Flagship events- Events that have a budget of over £500 or a large portion of your groups' account balance- Events with more than 75 attendees- Events that are organised alongside an external organisation- Events centred around alcohol (club nights/wine tasting etc)For smaller events, please complete the Regular Event Form instead. SUBMIT HEREForms for any 2024/25 events can If you're unsure which form to complete, please email su.societies@lse.ac.uk or su.sport@lse.ac.uk and we'll be able to advise.For any trips to locations beyond the M25 or include an overnight stay, please visit the Trips page and complete a Trip Form.Key Links and DocumentsRisk AssessmentBudget Template (if the event costs over £500 or over 50% of your club or society balance) Required Notice PeriodsTo ensure the form can be processed, please submit the event form with plenty of notice. The minimum notice the SU requires is:Regular events: 10 working daysEvents with high risk or high profile speakers: 1 monthForms for flagships and large events need to be submitted before the given deadline each term, as they require much more detailed planning and support. Autumn Term Flagships and Large Events: 1st September 2024Winter Term Flagships and Large Events: 31st October 2024Summer Term Flagships and Large Events: 28th February 2025The Planning ProcessTo help with getting events delivered effectively and safely, we have broken down the events planning process into 5 main steps:STEP 1 - Submit an Event Proposal Form within the required timeframeThis should always be the first step of the events planning process.Please attach a completed risk assessment to the event form, and a budget if the event costs over £500 or over 50% of your club or society budget. Please see the sections further down this page for more info on Risk Assessments and BudgetsEvent Form Top TipsThe SU operates a first-come-first-served queuing system for all event forms. This means the Societies Team can only process event forms in order of submission, so the earlier you get them in the queue, the earlier you can begin promotion and ticketing! If the SU team aren’t able to approve your form in time for your event, you may be asked to rearrange.The SU can make edits to forms, so don’t worry about confirming every single detail in the initial submission. We’d rather you submit a vague form that we can work on over time, than finalising all your event details but only letting us know about it 3 days before it’s due to take place!Please submit a form and await approval before promoting the event or making any concrete plans with external companies speakers. No payments related to an event can be made until the event form has been approved. Please factor this in your planning timescale! STEP 2 - SU Staff Approval (and other stakeholders)We aim to respond to all event forms within 5 working days, but this may be a little longer in busy periods. When the form is processed, you will be assigned a staff lead, usually one of the Societies Coordinators, or the Societies Manager. Please direct all communications and payments for your event through your designated staff lead. They are there to support you and help ensure your event planning runs smoothly.There may be some back-and-forth at this stage in order to ensure the event form is approvable. This would usually include making adjustments to the risk assessment and consolidating the budget.We may also need to consult other stakeholders, such as LSE Generate, LSE Careers and PAGE, to ensure the event doesn't overlap with any of their existing events, or to see if they can provide any extra support. This can sometimes take extra time, so please factor this in to your planning if you're preparing an event involving networking or external companies.If you wish to run a careers event in collaboration with an external organisation, please also contact LSE Careers at least 8 weeks before the event is due to take place. You can find out more information about their available support and guidance here. STEP 3 - Booking Rooms and VenuesOnce the SU has approved your form, it will be time to confirm your room!For LSE Rooms, it will be sent to the LSE Room Bookings Team, who will then contact you to confirm a suitable space, depending on the event requirements. We’re very lucky that LSE allow societies to use their spaces for free!For LSESU (Saw Swee Hock) Spaces, your staff lead will book you a space.For External Spaces, if you have any venue contracts, please don't sign these yourself. Please upload them here, and the SU will sign them on your behalf.You can make provisional bookings for some LSE spaces through Resource Booker yourself, by registering here. These provisional rooms won't be confirmed until the SU has approved your event form. To gain these Room Booking privileges you'll need to have completed the Room Bookings online training module..STEP 4 - Event LogisticsThis is where you work with your designated staff lead to organise any required logistics and the finer details of the event.CateringIf you’d like to order catering for your event:Events in LSE rooms: Please have a look at the options available here, then email your order to your staff lead. Please note, some LSE rooms are only licensed to host LSE Catering. If you wish to provide your own food for an event, please specify this on your event form so Room Bookings can allocate a suitable room.Events in LSESU rooms: Please visit this page and follow the instructions.All catering orders must be submitted a minimum of 10 working days before your event, to ensure the catering teams have enough time to organise necessary provisions and staffing. Please ensure catering is included on your budget and risk assessment! AV Support (DTS)If you would any microphones or projectors at your event, or if you need any webinars setting up, please let your staff lead know at least 10 working days in advance of the event. Extra FurnitureLSE Porters can provide any extra furniture that you need for an event, such as a registration desk or chairs and tables for speakers. If you require these, please let your staff lead know at least 5 working days in advance of the event.STEP 5 - Ticketing and PromotionOnce the event is approved and details have been confirmed, it’s time to start advertising!TicketingWe always recommend ticketing your events. Free tickets are a great way to manage capacity, and charging for tickets is a great source of income for your group. They are also essential if you're inviting non-LSE attendees to the event, so that you can provide the building's reception with a list of their names to allow entry.Native is the SU’s ticketing platform. At the start of each year, all registered groups will receive an email from Native with instructions on how to set up tickets. Once you’ve set up your tickets, please let your staff lead know so that they can set them live.There's plenty of support available to help you set up your tickets:Native Training SlidesHow to Create an EventHow to Set Up Tickets Use of external platforms must be pre-approved by your SU staff lead, and are only permitted if the event is:FreeLSE attendees onlyDeemed low riskIf your event matches the above criteria and you’d like to use an external platform, please discuss this with your staff lead. Promoting Your EventThe SU can support you with promoting your event if you wish to attract a wider audience.

They may look complicated at first, but once you get used to it, they'll become much easier! They allow us to consdier the potential risks of an event, and think of ways to reduce them, making the event as safe as possible.All event risk assessments should include:Trips, slips and fallsAttendee welfareFirst aid emergenciesCapacity controlFire hazards (keeping fire doors closed and exits clear etc.)Then, you'll need to consider specific risks related to the activity you're planning. For example, some other areas you may need to consider are:Crowd controlFood consumption (allergies, choking, hygiene, preparation, storage etc.)External speaker risks (reputational risk, controversial content covered, protests)Alcohol consumption (welfare, related injuries and illnesses)Electrical hazards (if using devices such as microphones, projectors, speakers or laptops)Heating and ventilationLightingZoom securityViolence, protests or political demonstrationsSound or loud musicFor a more extensive list of potential risks, please see the Risk Assessment Template at the top of this page.Then, think carefully about how the risks you identify can be mitigated. The more detail you go into, the better!Click here to see some examples of how risks can be mitigatedHazardAction Taken Before EventAction Taken During the EventZoom Security - uninvited attendees enter the call- Ensure the Zoom call is password protected - Ask the SU to set up a webinar, so only the host and panellists can be seen and heard.- Don't post the joining link publicly. Only share the link with those who have signed up for the event, and encourage them not to share elsewhere.- Enable the waiting room, then only admit people who are on your attendee list.- Immediately remove any attendees who are causing trouble- Have a designated committee member who monitors the chat and/or attendee behaviour- Remind attendees at the start of event what kind of behaviour is acceptable.Crowd Control- Ensure the event is ticketed so that room capacity limits aren't exceeded- Brief committee members on fire capacities, regulations, & emergency exits- Have a full list of attendees which can be used in the case of any evacuations.- Have members of your committee act as stewards during the event, to direct people to their seats, check tickets on the doors and supervise fire escapes in case they're required.- Brief attendees of fire exit routes at the start of the event.Electrical Equipment and Wiring- Ask your SU's staff lead to arrange LSE's DTS team to help you with setting up electrical equipment.- Ensure any wiring is safely stored, or if that's not possible, ensre it is clearly signed.- Ensure stewards are aware of fire escapes, and first aid provision in the event location.- Ensure no society member tried to move ro adjust electrical equipment.- Report any broken or seemingly unsafe equipment to the building's reception.External Speaker Risks- Do thorough research on your speaker in advance, so you're aware of any potential controversies that may lead to issues before or during the event.- Decide on your questions and topics of discussion, and share them with the speaker in advance of the event.- Arrange an academic chair who will moderate the conversation, ensuring free speech is upheld, and who will deal with any difficulties.- Thoroughly brief the academic chair in advance of the event, so they're aware of the speaker, the topics covered, and any potential matters of contention.- Ensure event stewards know how to contact security if anything escalates.- You may wish to only open the event to LSE students, so that you can monitor attendance. - Let the SU know if you receive any backlash regarding your speaker when advertising the event. We can then help to support you to make the event as safe as possible.- Inform the SU immediately if there were any issues at the event.- Ensure your academic chair is present and in a position to intervene should they need to.- Send round a feedback form after the event and encourage people to let you know if their welfare was negatively impacted by the event. Please let us know in this case so that we can support.BUDGETSThe best way to cover the costs of your event is to charge for tickets. You can subsidise these tickets using your society's money to make the event more inclusive. You can also apply for the Students' Union Fund if your activity meets the criteria!Some events cost very little, especially if you just want to provide a few snacks for your attendees. However, larger events often have more associated costs to consider, including:Venue HireAV Technicians (if out of hours)Catering Security hireSpeaker travel/ accommodation reimbursementsSpeaker giftsDecorationsMarketing materials (eg. sponsored social media posts)We generally don't recommend spending large proportions of your society's balance on one-off events, to ensure your group remains financially sustainable. To ensure your events are financially viable, you may need to submit a budget. Templates can be found here, and should be attached to your event form if either:the event costs over £500the event would cost over 50% of your club or society budgetTop Tips for Event Budgeting!Don’t worry if you can only estimate your costs to start with. You can always update your budgets as the planning progresses, just keep your staff lead informed.It's a good idea to create a shared list/ payment plan with your organising committe, to keep track of what has been paid and what is still outstanding. If you’re collaborating with another group on an event, you'll need to decide between you who is the financial lead. All finances relating to the event will go through the lead (but internal transfers between societies can be arranged if needed) If you're inviting external speakers to your event and have agreed to reimburse their travel or accommodation, it's a good idea to agree a reasonable 'reimbursement limit' with them in advance of them making any bookings. This means you aren't met with any suprises when they submit their reimbursement requestsEXTERNAL SPEAKERSLSESU Clubs and Societies invite hundreds of speakers every year, to discuss a wide variety of topics.If your group wishes to invite a speaker onto campus, you must make the SU aware by including their names and a brief description on your event form.SU staff will conduct a background check on the speaker. This is to ensure we can put measures in place to ensure the event is as safe as possible, for your group, your audience, your speaker and for the wider LSE community.If the speaker is high-profile, or something controversial comes up on our search, we'll circulate details of the event to the LSE Risk Spotters group, which is comprised of various LSESU and LSE staff members. They will then share any recommendations they have to ensure the safety of the event.Also, you may be required to have an academic chair at your event. This is to ensure freedom of speech is upheld. You will be required to find an academic chair if:Your event is open to the public, and/or students from other universitiesYour speaker is high-profile, or coudl require extra security considerationsThe topics you're discussing could attract strongly differing views (regardless of where your society sits within these views)Please don't advertise your speaker until the SU have approved your event. This is to ensure both the SU and the School are aware of who is being invited to speak on campus, and to protect your group.You'll also need to email the name(s) of your speakers to the reception of the building where your event is taking place. This will ensure they're allowed access on the day of the event.ACADEMIC CHAIRSAn academic chair is required at any event on LSE Campus that's:open to the public (including students from other universities)          and/or: Your speaker is high-profile, or could require extra security considerationsThe topics you're discussing could attract strongly differing views (regardless of where your society sits within these views)This must be a full-time member of academic staff. This directory may help, as you can add a filter to find academic staff.For more information about LSE's academic chair requirements, please visit this page and scroll down to the 'Opening Events to the Public' section.It is your group's responsibility to fully brief your chair in advance of an event. You may wish to discuss the structure of the event, topics of discussion, and details of your invited speakers. Please also send them LSE's Chairnotes, to ensure they know what their role entails.This is an LSE requirement, as a condition of using their spaces. Therefore, we recommend reaching out to potential chairs early on, to ensure you can secure one in time. Otherwise, the event will unfortunately need to be rearranged.FILM SCREENINGSIf you wish to screen a film, documentary or TV programme, you must acquire the relevant licenses.

"	Consent Ed Skip to content  Sabbatical Officer and PTO projects Consent EdConsent EdIt started as a student-led campaign and motion and by Michaelmas Term 2021, 3000 LSE students received training from the Consent.Ed project.CONSENT ED CAMPAIGNIn the 2021/22 academic year, the LSESU spearheaded the ‘Consent.Ed’ programme. The consent education campaign was launched during the Welcome period and then proceeded to extend past Welcome and into the 2020 Michaelmas term. However the origins of the project date back for many years with there being an ongoing conversation about sexual and gender based violence prevention and consent education amongst the LSE student population since at least 2017. The execution of this project began as a student motion by Laura Goodard (LSESU Community and Welfare Officer 2020-21) who started Hands-Off LSE (student-led campaign group).TRAINING The programme consists of a short online course for pre-arrival and a 1.5 hour in-person workshop in specific Halls of Residences and on the LSE campus. The in-perso n sessions are facilitated by LSE students, trained by LSESU on how to facilitate consent workshops to their peers. GOALSThe goals of the ‘Consent.Ed’ programme are:To prevent sexual and gender-based violence and create a consent culture at LSE.Provide a comprehensive understanding on the topic of consent that is relevant for a	university setting.Have a focus on active bystander intervention and therefore equip students with	knowledge on how to handle situations where consent might be violated and how to	support members of their community.Educate students on the support available to them both at LSE and beyond.Consent.Ed workshops are therefore designed to equip students to be an active bystander, inform students about the support available at LSE and beyond, and comprehensively educate students on the topic of consent. HOW THE CAMPAIGN HAS CHANGED THE STUDENT EXPERIENCEAs a result of the positive response to the campaign, completion of ‘Consent.Ed’ is now mandatory for admission into ‘Carol’  for core committee members of clubs and societies and first-year undergraduates. For second and third year UGs the online training is compulsory for attendance of Carol. Since ‘Consent.Ed’ was implemented, research produced by students through the Change Makers Research Programme reflected on consent education at LSE and also the impact of the ‘Consent.Ed’ campaign on LSE students. ‘Consent.Ed’ also acknowledged student concerns about safety and spiking across the UK and collaborated with a LSESU campaign group called ‘Hands Off LSE’ to discuss student concerns and for the SU to communicate our current and newer spiking safety measures in the SU ‘Three Tuns’ bar.GETTING INVOLVEDComplete the Online Training Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:56,155e5abde93a6f0f9736542d50d63bbb,Consent Ed,https://www.lsesu.com/support/funding/sabbaticalofficerandptoprojects/consentedcamp/

If one isn't provided automatically, please ask the shop/ restaurant for one!THE PROCESS: InvoicesYou can also pay someone directly from your LSESU account by submitting an invoice. Request an invoice from the company you want us to pay, and just email it to either su.societies@lse.ac.uk or su.sport@lse.ac.uk.We can pay invoices in a foreign currency, but please be aware that international transactions usually incur a fee, which will be charged to your club or society.All invoices must:Be correctly addressed to LSE Students' Union, Saw Swee Hock Student Centre, 1 Sheffield Street, London, WC2A 2APInclude the suppliers details (name, address, e-mail)Have an invoice dateHave an invoice numberInclude a VAT number (if applicable)Include details and dates of servicesHave a correct total on invoiceInclude the suppliers bank account detailsIf your invoice exceeds £10,000 please allow at least two weeks for this as this needs to be escalated to senior management. If you have an invoice which has already been paid, please submit it alongside a payment request form and proof of payment, and the payee of the invoice will be reimbursed.important things to remember...Club or Society money cannot be used to reimburse items or social that are only for your committee or select members.Any spending on events should only happen once an event form has been approved.

This membership is essentially a contribution towards the running costs of the group.MembershipsGroup MembershipsFor clubs the minimum charge must be £10 and for societies it is £1.50. Every year these must be reviewed. We can help you structure your memberships in your development meetings in July.Types of MembershipStandard MembershipEvery group as a minimum must have a standard membership with a set price that students can purchase. This membership usually provides the most access to a groups activities and events. With this membership a student is automatically included in the Students' Union Insurance Policy.Give It A Go Mailing List/MembershipThis membership is free and is only available between August - October. Every student group is expected to have one. It is a chance for students to register their interest with a student group to get emails and information about the welcome sessions and give it a go events that groups put on. They expire on the 31st October so make sure you email them around that time to convert them to paid members.Other Types of MembershipsOur groups have many membership structures. Other clubs and societies also have team based memberships which give access to different levels of training or support. They may have division memberships which provide access to certain events and activities.Associate MembershipsAssociate memberships allow LSE staff and alumni to be able to become members, not the public. Student groups can apply to have an associate membership, and  the Activities Committee will review this.

Find out how best to promote your group and how LSESU can help.Our top tipsGetting students to know about your activity and events can be one of the most difficult things about running a society. That's why we've compiled our top tips for getting yourself noticed and building up your member base.There are so many things that you can do yourself, have a look below for some ideas. LSESU website pageDid you know that every student group has a webpage on the LSESU site?This is the first point of call for incoming students to find out about your society. Make sure you have as much information on here as possible, it will make you look appealing and active. Members of your student group committee can edit this information, they must have admin rights to do this, more information can be found in Module 3 of the training. Event listing on the LSESU website If you have a student group event coming up that you wish to promote, then you can list it on the ‘What’s On’ page of the LSE website. For more information check out Module 3 on the training page on the website. Social media If you don’t have a facebook page or a twitter account for your society then you should definitely consider getting them, social media is playing an ever-increasing important role in the majority of people’s lives.Some tips:Don’t post too much on facebook- it can an invasive form of communication if you bombard people every hour of the dayFacebook will automatically promote picture and video content ten times more than pure text content organically, so bear this in mindTwitter can be used much more regularly- short, snappy, amusing contentCreate facebook events for your events so that people have all the info in one place, are reminded about it, and can invite their own friends tooIf you want a way of managing your facebook and twitter accounts in one place, and a way of scheduling posts in bulk, then programmes like Hootsuite are easy and free to use HootSuite(Opens in new tab). Tweetdeck is also a useful programme for monitoring twitter TweetDeck(Opens in new tab) Sheffield Street Stall Registered clubs and societies can book stall spaces on Sheffield Street, located outside the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre. This is a great place to promote your group or a specific event due to the amount of foot fall.If you would like to book a stall for your club or society to promote an event or to fund-raise, please call contact the LSESU Front of House team at su.info@lse.ac.uk. Please note fundraising currently has to be done via cashless methods. Stall bookings are availble Monday to Friday between 10am and 4pm and on a first come first serve basis. Full details will be given upon confirmation of your booking. Give It A Go Give It A Go sessions are a great way to try a club or society with no pressure to join afterwards. Give It A Go is all about exploring LSESU’s amazing, student-led sports clubs, societies and the media group. Give It A Go sessions run throughout the year, for more information and tips on running a session visit the Give It A Go area. Posters and flyers We'd generally discourage the printing of flyers due to the environmental impact. If you wish to display any posters, please only do so in the SU building, and in the designated poster spaces. Don't forget to take them down once the event has passed!Student group opportunitiesWe provide your student group with a number of opportunities to get involved with. Collaboration with other groups Working with other groups to collaborate on activities throughout the year, can really help boost your awareness of events and membership. Often collaborating helps the groups attract more people, and provide an experience for members that they would never have been able to do if acting alone.LSESU offers networking events for Society Committee members during the academic year to help facilitate this kind of collaboration, and we strongly encourage you to attend! Campaigns One of the best ways of collaborating with others is to join in with one of the Union’s campaigns that run year-round, or to ask LSESU staff to help you launch a campaign of your own. Our Engagement Team can provide you with training and help you secure funding for a wide range of campaigns that support the values of our organisation and promote the interests of LSE students.By teaming with others across the Union, you have the chance to bring about change both within the LSE community and in society as a whole. If you are interested in involving your society in a campaign, please contact us and we will try to give you the help you need. Recognition As a student group you can get involved in the Student Training Awards and Recognition Scheme (STARS) which recognises well-run, inclusive and fun student groups. Receiving STARS can increase your website presence and benefits.What can LSESU do to help?At LSESU we have our own presence on social media, with thousands of followers, as well as a specific email that goes out to promote club and society activity and events.Our Communications Team will always do their best to promote your activities, or indeed to help you celebrate your achievements afterwards, by scheduling some coverage on one or more of those platforms.If you would like support on promotion, then all you need to do is tag @lsesu in your stories and we will share this for you!

This page outlines all the information you need to be able to plan a successful Give It A Go event.Give It A Go events can run throughout the year, but a lot of sports clubs and societies run events during the Welcome period (first three weeks of Michaelmas Term) and the Refresher period (first two weeks of lent Term). Please use the steps on this page to plan your Give It A Go Event.Planning your sessionStep 1: Choose your ThemeFirstly, decide what activity you could do that represents your group. For some, such as sports and martial arts groups this is straight forward but for others, you may need to be creative. Activities in the past have ranged from learning sign language, rock climbing, cheese and wine tasting to website development. To help you with this, you should develop your Give It A Go session around one of the themes: Get Active, Learn A Skill, Relax and Socialise, Be Creative, and Share Your Culture.Get ActiveGet Active sessions are free taster sessions that showcase a range of sports and physical activities, such as floorball, martial arts, ballet, badminton, salsa, 3-a-side tennis, etc. These sessions offer a great chance for students who want to take part in physical activities to meet the clubs and societies at LSE that cater for this.Learn A SkillLearn A Skill sessions are free taster sessions that showcase a range of vast array of activities, such as baking, photography, journalism, hockey stick skills, debating, financial management, computer coding, statistics etc. These sessions offer a great chance for students who want to take part in activities that add to their skill set to meet the clubs and societies at LSE that cater for this.Relax and SocialiseRelax and Socialise sessions are free taster sessions that showcase a range of extracurricular activities that help you unwind after a day of lectures, such as wine sampling, cider education, a shisha social, a trip to a tourist attraction or the cinema, afternoon tea, to meet students with similar interests such as anime or gaming, etc. These sessions offer a great chance for students who want to take a break from the books to meet the clubs and societies at LSE that cater for this.Be CreativeBe Creative sessions are free taster sessions that showcase a range of activities that help you to flex your creative muscles, such as photography, life drawing, impov, singing, dance, music, digital art, etc. These sessions offer a great chance for students who still want to hone their creativity while at LSE to meet the clubs and societies at LSE that cater for this.Share Your CultureShare Your Culture sessions celebrate the myriad of cultures that co-exist in LSE and we have a huge number of national and cultural societies (68) and a sizable international student population (65%). Share Your Culture sessions can include Sheffield Street stalls which can encompass all the different Give It A Go themes: Get Active - showcase a national sport or dance, Learn A Skill - give a language demonstration, Relax and Socialise - give out traditional sweets or listen to some music, Be Creative - recreate some famous artwork or put a twist on traditional clothing.Challenge, Debate, TalkWe know that LSE students love to challenge the status quo and debate about policial issues to ensure social science moves foward. That is why a range of our societies put on Give It A Go sessions which talk about all kinds of topics, issues and agendas. One of these sessions may have speakers or a panel or just allow students to lead the conversation themselves.Try Something NewNot everything can fit in to a define catagory, and that is why we simply have - try something new. If you are not sure where you society or club activity could be catagories, this simply works for everything. Specially our activty and special interest groups!Step 2:Complete and Submit Your Documents To The UnionTo ensure your event is approved by the Union you must: Complete submit an event formComplete a risk assessment using a template and attach to your event form.Create a an event on the Union WebsiteIf you need funding support, please apply for the activities fundStep 3: Promote Your EventMake sure you create an event on the lsesu website so it can be promoted by the Union.

If it is a daylong activity, it should fall on the weekend to allow most people to attend.You should work with your committee to devise a title, a short description and an itinerary of the event. Make sure that you allocate tasks to your members to ensure that the event runs smoothly on the day. When writing your description, make the event sound fun. Don't put lots of exclamation marks - they don't make it sound more exciting.Evening slots between 6pm and 9pm are the most popular time to run sessions, so you should think carefully about when you would like to run yours as you can end up competing for space and participants.Due to COVID you may be debating whether to hold your event in person or digitally. We have guidance for you to be able to deliver either.

"	LSESU Charity Shop Skip to content  Sabbatical Officer and PTO projects Sustainability Hub LSESU Charity ShopLSESU Charity ShopCome visit us at 31 Portugal Street, London WC2A 2HE!   A message from Romane BranthommeThe Charity Shop is a project originally proposed by Sustainable Futures Society (SFS) to the Sustainability Team at LSE. When the project got approved, LSE estate's team offered the society to take over the old Santander space. As this project was quite ambitious, I took it over from the societies team and made it a Sabbatical Officer Project! I reached out to a little bit more societies, such as Raising & Giving (RAG), Circular Economy, Eco Soc, Fashion Business, Visual Arts. In the end, we got a bit of help from everyone to promote clothes donation but the project was mainly led by RAG and SFS! It took us almost a whole academic year to get the space but now we have it and it looks great!! I'm really happy that LSE gave us this opportunity and I hope it can go on in the next academic year. Romane was the Activities and Development Sabbatical Officer for the 22/23 academic year. During her time as A&D Sabb, Romane launched a new partnership with Kitlocker, which provides sports kits for LSE sports teams. She supported the Atheltics Union committee, organised a big Varsity against Imperial, encouraged collaborations between student groups,  and worked with  green societies and RAG to open this charity shop!  Can't find us?     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by LSESU RAG (Raising & Giving) (@lsesu.rag)outfit inspo    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by LSESU RAG (Raising & Giving) (@lsesu.rag)more content @charity shop INSTA: Instagram (opens in a new tab)RAG INSTA:Instagram (opens in a new tab)Lookbook                                             Explore this section:Your Union About Us Our History Trustee Board Union Policies Contact Us Work With Us Advertise Privacy and Data Complaints COVID-19 UpdatesLondon School of Economics and Political Sciences Students' Union,    ",2024-07-23 15:28:57,54cb4ea2512a7d72b6af6363b6650136,LSESU Charity Shop,https://www.lsesu.com/support/funding/sabbaticalofficerandptoprojects/sustainabilityhub_/charityshop/
