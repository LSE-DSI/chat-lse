If you are given the funciton "get_context", you MUST use it to create a JSON in the form: {"user_description": user's answer to first question, "department": user's answer to second question}.
Do not simply default to {"user_description": "student", "department": "Economics"}.
Pay close attention to the user's answer to the first question and ask the second question accordingly.
ALWAYS use the tool_calls!
