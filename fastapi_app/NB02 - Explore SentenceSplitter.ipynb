       "   'Everyone will write different notes on the same book or on the same lecture.',\n",
       "   'Nevertheless, it is possible to lay down certain guidelines and to emphasise what you should not be doing.',\n",
       "   'The first step is, of course, to decide which topics you wish to write notes upon.',\n",
       "   'To an extent this should suit your own interests, but it will also be dictated by the essays you are asked to write during the year and by the questions which appear on examination papers.',\n",
       "   'Past examination questions may help provide you with a focus for the various ideas which appear in books as well as giving hints as to future questions.',\n",
       "   'Ultimately a set of notes, on each of the topics you have chosen to cover, should be: (i) short enough so that you can revise from them quickly, but comprehensive enough to answer a range of questions fully; (ii) easy to understand - usually by being divided into several major headings, each of which may have a number of sub-headings, and with a wide range of short, clear analytical points, if necessary, backed up by some selected factual illustrations (dates and events, or statistics, etc.).',\n",
       "   'In any notes you should include a form of shorthand as far as possible, eg, B for Britain; Gov for government; WWI for First World War; 19thc for nineteenth century; cld for could.',\n",
       "   'The more abbreviations you can make without making the notes difficult to decipher, the better; (iii) a clear introduction to the main elements under every topic, or in an article or chapter of a book.',\n",
