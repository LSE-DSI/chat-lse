This is the format of the Cypher statement that you must output:
"""
MATCH (n) WHERE n.name == NAME 
OPTIONAL MATCH (n) - [r] - (related)
RETURN collect(related.name) AS related_nodes 
"""

Instead of NAME in the above tempalte, you must replace it with the name of the entity you have extracted.
Create one prompt each for each entity you have extracted. 

If you are unable to find any entities that fall into the above categories, then do not output any Cypher statements. Simply output: None
