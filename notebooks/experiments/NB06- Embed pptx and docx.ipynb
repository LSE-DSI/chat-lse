GOOD NEWS: writing essays, making a point in seminar discussions, recognising arguments and evidence in texts are all part of exam skills!  For one-hour essays Contains around 800-1000 words: an introduction, 4 or 5 paragraphs, and a conclusion (BUT, quality over quantity!). The introduction answers the question and outlines the argument in support of this answer. Each paragraph begins with a clear statement that helps answer the question; and combines reference to the literature and other sources to justify and support the main idea of the paragraph in a detailed and convincing manner. The conclusion summarises the argument and discusses the ‘so what’ (wider perspective). Qualitative topic exams & timing  12 3 6 9  12 3 6 9  Read all the questions on the exam paper.

       "  'text': '1 Policy Statement: Ex-Offenders LSE actively promotes equality of opportunity for all and actively welcomes applications from a wide range of applicants, including those with criminal records. LSE uses the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to help assess the suitability of applicants when recruiting to positions that are likely to involve working with children or vulnerable adults, or other positions of trust. Therefore, LSE complies fully wi th the DBS Code of Practice and undertakes to treat all applicants fairly. LSE also undertakes not to discriminate unfairly against any subject of a DBS check on the basis of a conviction or any information revealed. All applicants who apply for position s requiring a DBS check will be made aware of the Code of Practice during the recruitment process and will be provided with a copy on request. This policy will be made available to all Disclosure applicants at the outset of the recruitment process through LSE’s website. All applicants will be asked to declare any unspent criminal convictions when applying for a position at LSE. This information will only be viewed by appropriate staff within the HR Division and will not be automatically passed on to hiring managers. Unless the nature of the position allows LSE to ask questions about an individual’s entire criminal record, LSE will only ask about unspent convictions as defined in the Rehabil itation of Offenders Act 1974. Failure to declare any unspent convictions may lead to an offer of employment being withdrawn. LSE will ensure that every recruitment decision related to DBS checks or other safe guarding concerns will be overseen by an individual who has been suitably trained to identify and assess the relevance and circumstances of any offences disclosed. LSE will also ensure that appropriate guidance and training has been provided in the relevan t legislation relating to the employment of ex -offenders, e.g. the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. At interview, or in a separate discussion, LSE will ensure that an open and measured discussion takes place on the subject of any offences or other in formation revealed that might be relevant to the position. Failure to reveal information that is directly relevant to the position sought may lead to an offer of employment being withdrawn. LSE undertakes to discuss any matter revealed on a DBS certifica te with the individual seeking the position before withdrawing a conditional offer of employment. Having a criminal record will not nece ssarily bar an individual from working with LSE, depending upon the nature of the position sought as well as the circums tances of the revealed offence. '},\n",

       "  'text': '1 Operational LSE Policy and Procedure on Personal Relationships LSE Policy on Personal Relationships Introduction Positive p rofessional relationships between staff, and between staff and students, which facilitate learning, research and the exchange of ideas, are recognised as integral to the success of the School. However, due to the power relationships that can exist between staff, and between staff and students, personal relationships which go beyond a professional working relationship can result in a conflict of interest, impacting on constructive and transparent working relations or resulting in adverse effects on the student experience. M ore seriously, these can result in abuse of power or the potential for, or perception of, abuse of power. The School’ s Ethics Code includes Integrity and Equality of Respect and Opportunity as tw o of the Code ’s six key principles. These detail the School’s commitment to declaring interests and appropriately managing possible conflicts as well as treating all people with dignity and respect, being transparent and consistent with our decision making and ensuring that no person is treated less favourably as a result of any of the protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010. All academic, research, teaching and professional services staff are in a position of trust. It is important that they demonstrate professional behaviour and act in accordance with the Ethics Code. Due attention should be given to individual actions and conduct to ensure that this is appropriate to the activities being undertaken. The Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violenc e Policy sets out the School’s commitment to provide a safe environment free from sexual harassment and violence. This includes behaviour which extends beyond the physical premises and normal business hours of the School, such as conduct at events and tri ps abroad or on social media. Sexual harassment also occurs if an individual treats a person less favourably because that person has rejected or submitted to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature. Policy Aims The purpose of this policy and procedure is to set out the expectations and responsibilities of staff, students and the remainder of the LSE community specifically in respect of personal relationships between staff, and between staff and students, but also in respect of any personal relationship that includes a power imbalance. This is in order to prevent abuses of power, protect staff and students 2 from allegations of conflicts of interest and promote a safe and positive environment. The policy sets out what constitutes a conflict of interest and the steps that must be taken where these exist to ensure that th ey are managed in an appropriate and timely manner to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest, or misuse of power and authority. It explains the steps that must be taken by members of the LSE c ommunity to ensure that any personal relationships at work are handled with integrity so that they do not impact on the work ing lives of staff or the student experience and/or give rise to uni ntended consequences. Where disclosures regarding personal relationships are made, these will be handled sensitively and confidentially. Scope of Policy This policy applies principally to all staff and students at LSE but can, under certain circumstances, also apply to other members of the LSE community (see section on ‘Definitions’ ). It also applies to : - job applicants in so far as they are requested to declare any personal relationships with existing staff in the ir applic ation form ; - individuals applying to become student s in so far as the staff member has influence over whether the student is admitted. The policy and associated principles apply equally to all relationships at work regardless of sexual orientation and identity. Existing Relationships Relationships that exist at the time of the publication of th is policy must be declared within three month s of this policy coming into effect in accordance with the section below: ‘Declaring Personal Relationships’. There may be existing, consensual personal relationship s that are declared within three months of the launch, which are now prohibited under this procedure. In such cases, new practical arrangements will be found with advice from HR that fully resolve a ny potential conflicts of interest to the mutual agreement of both parties. Definitions Personal relationships: a relationship which transgresses professional boundaries and may lea d to real or perceived conflicts of interest, or misuse of power and authority at work. Examples of personal relationships include: - a family relationship - a business/co mmercial/financial relationship - a romantic/ intimate/ sexual relationship (including a brief or one-off occurrence) 3 - a close personal/social friendship, which exists outside of the workplace. However personal relationships are not restricted to these examples and anyone who is in a situation which could lead to a potential confl ict of interest, as set out in this policy, must declare it as outlined below. Staff member: any individual who is employed by LSE, or engaged to carry out work for LSE, including PhD students, visiting staff, guest and emeritus teachers, and hourly -paid staff. This may include students who are also employed on teaching or research contracts, when they are acting in those capacities. Student: all undergraduate and postgraduate students, full -time and part -time students, including those enrolle d in University of London, Summer S chool or executive programmes and those carrying out distance learning. LSE community includes but is not limited to all students, salaried and non -salaried members of staff (including visiting staff), alumni, contractors and members of Council as well as other individuals who are authorised to be on School premises for the purposes of work or study. A conflict of interest may arise where an individual might be seen to be influencing School matters for actual, potential or perceived personal benefit. Such a conflict may arise in a situation when an employee, governor or registered student is in a p osition to influence, directly or indirectly, School business, research or other decisions in ways that could lead to gain for them, their family or others. No one should be involved in making decisions in relation to their commitments to the School from which they, or anyone with whom they have a close financial or personal relationship, stand to personally benefit. Such considerations apply to a wide range of activities in which conflicts may arise, including, but not restricted to, student admissions, student assessment, disciplinary proceedings, appeals, staff recruitment, staff promotion and remuneration, procurement and assessing proposed relationships between the School and outside parties1. A historical relationship is one that has en ded. Historical consensual relationships that ended two or more years before the launch of this policy (1 September 2021) do not need to be declared. Consensual relationships that ended within two years of this policy’s launch must be declared but will not normally be investigated unless there are reasonable concerns that the past relationship continues to impact on current working relations and/or the student experience. These will be subject to the policy in place at the time of the relationship. Positional power: this is the authority held by virtue of one’s position in the organisation’s structure and hierarchy. Consent: permission for something to happen or agreement to do something with a full understanding of the facts and without coercion. Cons ent is not consent if it is given under pressure, (perceived or real) threat, or given when someone is not really capable of giving it – e.g. if they are intoxicated, asleep and/or not capable of giving consent. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. Exploited consent : consent that is secured only due to the occupancy of respective positions within an unequal relationship e.g. teacher and student. Exploited consent includes experiencing pressure (perceived or real) to give consent in order to improve marks, improve promotion, or where a person believes they would not receive due professional a ttention. 1 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and-procedures/Assets/Documents/conIntPol.pdf 4 Policy Principles LSE staff must conduct themselves professionally and appropriately in their dealings with colleagues and students, in line with the School’s Ethics Code2 and the School’s Safeguarding Policy3. The same guidelines and rules for appropriate conduct apply when staff and students are participating in fieldwork, conferences and other work -related activities away from the normal workplace, including when staff are on sabbatical leave. Personal, finan cial, family, romantic or sexual relationships between students and staff, and between staff members (even if they are of similar age), where there is a significant difference in real or perceived power, present special problems because these relationships are vulnerable to exploitation. The School’s Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Policy and Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Policy set out actions or behaviour which constitute harassment based on protected characteristics including gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, age and race. Improper behaviour, where a member of staff uses their power to exploit students/staff, w ill be treated as gross misconduct and dealt with through the relevant disciplinary procedure. Staff in positions of influence should ensure that their behaviour does not put students or staff in an uncomfortable or difficult position, for example, by s uggesting one-to-one meetings offsite in informal settings, such as restaurants, pubs or homes. Professional activity should be carried out at all times either in appropriate spaces ( offices, meeting rooms, caf és) on campus or using online communication tools. Due consideration should be given to the power imbalance that exists and c are should be taken to ensure that contact and behaviour are professional, appropriate and non -intimidating. LSE acknowledges that cases of exploited consent can occur in si tuations where consent is believed to have been freely given by both parties, but would not have been given if one party did not occupy a particular position of power. All personal relationships declared will be investigated and LSE will consider issues relating to any power imbalance that exists, such as the relative dependence and vulnerability of the student/staff member, and the esteem, respect and admiration which the student/staff member holds for the more senior staff member. The more these features are made apparent, the more the securing of consent to sexual or other intimacy may be seen as exploitative. With the above in mind, the following three fundamental policy principles apply: 1. LSE prohibits any personal relationships between staff and students where i) there is a direct supervisory relationship in existence (e.g. PhD student and supervis or); ii) a member of staff has direct or indirect responsibility for, or involvement in, that student’s ac ademic studies (for example, assessor of a student’s work) and/or personal welfare (for example, academic advisor and advisee) or iii) a member of staff interacts with a student as part of their role (including the period during which a prospective studen t is applying for admission, and any period of time after the completion of a degree during which the staff member maintains a direct or indirect professional role, such as mentoring or writing references for a former student ). Such relationships should be reported immediately in acco rdance with the procedure set out below so t hat appropriate safeguards are put in place, including changing the supervisory relationship or the relationship of direct responsibility for, or involvement in, the student’s acade mic studies and/or personal welfare. 2 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Secretarys -Division/Assets/Documents/Ethics/EthicsCodeA5postcard.pdf 3 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and-procedures/Assets/Documents/safPol.pdf 5 2. Where a personal relationship exists between a member of staff and student and where there is no professional relationship in existence, this must be reported in accordance with the procedure set out below to ensure transparency and so that any conflict of interest that arises from such a relationship can be resolved by putting new arrangements in place. 3. In order to mitigate possible co nflicts of interest, LSE prohibits staff members who are in a personal relationship from being in a supervisory role (for example, principal investigator and research staff on the grant) or in any other role of influence over their professional career (for example, line manager and staff who are line managed by them). In such cases, personal relationships between staff must be declared so that new arrangements can be found that fully resolve the conflict of interest. This policy does not ban social interactions between senior and junior colleagues; at the same time, this policy and the attached procedure applies to those situations where a level of social interaction and/or the extent of a personal relationship could give rise to conflict of interest concern s. LSE encourages the reporting of any concerns of wrongdoing and commits to ensuring that individuals are not adversely affected as a result of reporting such wrongdoing 4. Students and staff can also report sexual (and other) harassment anonymously via the LSE online reporting tool5. The report should detail the concerning behaviour and staff member(s) and/or student(s) involved. Historical relationships that are brought to the School’s attention by a member of the LSE Community, including alumni, whi ch have resulted in a detrimental impact on a member of staff or student, will be taken seriously and investigated as far as reasonably possible. Where there is an immediate or serious concern, other, more direct, reporting methods should be used, for example speaking to the Chief Operating Officer, who is the School’s designated Lead Safeguarding Officer, or the Deputy Chief Operating Officer in their absence. If any student or member of staff finds themselves in receipt of unwanted or inapp ropriate behaviour, is involved in a relationship that they do not consider to be truly consensual, or if they consider that they have been adversely affected by a misuse of power, authority, or conflict of interest, they should refer to the Sexual Harassm ent and Sexual Violence Policy and the guidance and support available on how to report this. Any complaint made by a student and/or member of staff will be investigated in accordance with the relevant staff or student procedure (see Related Policies and Guidance Documents section below). Staff or students involved in a personal relationship that is permitted within this policy should not be unfairly treated or suffer detriment. Where steps are being taken to deal with two individuals w ho are involved in a personal relationship, both parties will be treated fairly and consistently unless there are specific grounds to justify differing treatment, such as misconduct by one of the pa rties or power imbalance. Legislation The Human Rights Act 1998 (Article 8) provides for the right to a private and family life. This policy and procedure has been written to ensure that it balances an individual’s right to a private life w hile ensuring respect for LSE values of integrity and trust. The Equality Act 2010 obliges employers not to treat a woman less favourably than a man (or vice versa) becaus e of gender. It also gives workers the right not to be treated unfavourably because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. 4 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/Services/Policies -and-procedures/Assets/Documents/lsePubIntDisPro.pdf 5 lse.ac.uk/reportit 6 It is a criminal offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 for a person in a position of trust to engage in sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, even where the person is of the legal age of consent. 7 LSE Procedure on Personal Relationships Personal relationships between staff and students An inclusi ve student experience i s at the heart of LSE’s educational offering to students and the varied roles that all academic staff play in educating, supporting, coaching and mentoring students is crucial to this being a positive experience. In accordance with the Ethics Code, it is essential that staff act with integrity in all dealings with students to ensure that they can flourish both whilst they are at LSE and in their future career. As such, LSE believes that staff entering into a personal relationship w ith students is inconsistent with the important role they play and undermines the student’s educational experience. This can ultimately cause the student damage or harm, as well as potentially leading to claims being made against the member of staff with regards to misconduct, sexual harassment or discrimination. The following sets out the measures that are in place to ensure that both students and staff are protected in this context. Members of staff must not be in, or enter into, a close personal or intimate relationship with a student or staff member under the age of 18, or an adult known or suspected to be at risk. It is a criminal offence for staff who are responsible for students to enter into a sexual relationship with any student below the age of 18 where the adult is in a position of trust. As stated in the LSE Policy on Personal Relationships: LSE prohibits any personal relationships between staff and students where i) there is a direct supervisory relationship in existence ( e.g. PhD student and supervisor) ; ii) where a member of staff has direct or indirect responsibility for, or involvement in, that student’s academic studies (for example, assessor of a student’s work) and/or personal welfare (for example, academic advisor and advis ee); or iii) a member of staff interacts with a student as part of their role (including the period during which a prospective student is applying for admission, and any period of time after the completion of a degree during which the staff member maintai ns a direct or indirect professional role, such as mentoring or writing references for a former student). Where such a relationship exists, the policy prohibits, where that is the case, that a staff member remains in direct supervision (for example, PhD student and supervisor) or has direct or indirect responsibility for, or involvement in, that student’s academic studies (for example, marker of a student’s work) and/or personal welfare (for example, academic advisor and advisee). Instead, new arrangemen ts need to be found that fully resolve the conflict of interest. Regardless of the above, s taff must declare any form of intimate or close personal relationship with any student so that any actual or potential conflicts of interest can be managed appropr iately. This includes staff members who ha ve a pre- existing relationship with someone who becomes a student. A declaration must be made in accordance with the ‘Declaring Personal Relationships’ section below. Following a declaration, the line manager or Head of Department will consult with their HR Partner and an investigation will be conducted. Where a personal relationship involves the line manager or Head of Department, the investigation will be conducted by another appropriate manager in the School. If, as a result of the investigation, it is reasonably believed that misconduct has occurred, this will lead to a formal disciplinary investigation. Misconduct include s, but is not limited to, coercion, an abuse of power, grooming, favouritism, unwanted sexual advances or an intimate or sexual relationship. Where a relationship is not found to constitute misconduct, the investigation will consider i) whether 8 there is a conflict of interest or potential for a perceived conflict of interest and ii) what a ctions can be put in place to mitigate the conflict. Any undeclared relationships between staff and students, or other contraventions of this procedure, will be regarded as a disciplinary matter. Where the staff member has direct supervision, direct or indirect responsibility for, or involvement in, that student’s academic studies and/or personal welfare, or the nature of the relationship constitutes an abuse of power, it will be regarded as a matte r of gross misconduct and the member of staff will be suspended in line with the relevant disciplinary procedure. A full investigation will be undertaken in all cases and, if upheld, will result in disciplinary action against the staff member, up to and in cluding termination of employment. The above applies even when the student may, in parallel, hold an employment contract with the School. In all cases, c onsideration will take into account factors such as the nature and type of relationship, the duration o f the relationship and whether this existed prior to the person becoming a student, the extent of the power imbalance, any particular vulnerabilities that exist for the staff or student member, the nature of the contact between the two parties and/or the p otential for the member of staff to influence the student’s academic and career progression. Reasonable attempts will be made to obtain relevant information, in order to investigate historical allegations of an abuse of power that involve existing staff as far as possible, including any patterns of behaviour that emerge during the course of an investigation. Where such allegations are upheld, disciplinary action may be taken in line with the relevant procedure. Direct responsibility includes, but is not li mited to, direct management, direct supervision, assess ment of the s tudent ’s work, welfare or pastoral roles. Indirect responsibility includes, but is not limited to, recruitment and selection, teaching (formal and informal), student conduct issues, exten uating circumstances, the awarding, and processing, of bursaries and grants and the issuing of references. Indirect responsibility will also normally include a member of staff within the same department as a student where there is a significant power differential. Personal relationships between staff members As stated in the LSE Policy on Personal Relationships, LSE requires that personal relationships are declared in all cases where such a relationship results, or has the potential to result, in a conflict of interest. Where such a relationship develops or exists, the policy prohibits, where that is the case, that a staff member remains in a supervisory role (for example, principal investigator and research staff on the grant) or any other role of influence over their professional career (for example, line manager and staff who are line managed by them). Instead, new arrangements need to be found that fully resolve the conflict of interest. Declaration must be made in accordance with the ‘Declaring Personal Relationships’ section below. Any undeclared relationships between staff which result, or ha ve the ability to result in, a conflict of interest will be regarded as a disciplinary matter. A full investigation will be undertaken in all cases and, if upheld, will result in disciplinary action against the staff member, up to and including termination of employment. Following declaration, the line manager or Head of Department will consult with their HR Partner and consider i) whether there is a conflict of interest or potential for a perceived conflict of interest and ii) 9 what actions can be put in place to mitigate the conflict. Where a personal relationship involves the line manager or Head of Department, the investi gation will be conducted by another appropriate manager in the School. In considering whether there may be a conflict of interest, factors will be taken into account such as the nature of the relationship, including whether it is a relationship in which on e staff member has positional power over the other, the duration of the relationship and whether this existed prior to the working relationship, the extent of the power imbalance, the impact or potential impact on the individuals and others around them, th e nature of the decisions that may need to be taken as a result of the working relationship, the potential influence that one party may have on the other’s career progression and/or any particular vulnerabilities of either party. Examples include line management/supervision or being in the same line management chain, working together in a small team where the relationship dynamic has a greater impact, working together on key decis ion-making committees or groups. The relevant manager will consult with thei r HR Partner to consider the appropriate steps to be taken. Where an individual is involved in d ecision -making that would impact the other staff member, they will be immediately withdrawn from decision -making (e.g. promotions, review /reward decisions, appointment to permanent positions). The manager/Head of D epartment may consider transferring one party or both pa rties, making alternative line management or supervisory arrangements, seeking redeployment in line with the School’s Redeployment Policy and Procedure or implementing other appropriate arrangements to eliminate the conflict of interest, depending on the c ircumstances. In very rare circumstances, such alternative arrangements may not be feasible, and LSE may then have to consider dismissing one or both parties. Any actions required to mitigate the conflict of interest will be taken in consultation with the member(s) of staff. The manager making the decision regarding the measures to be put in place will notify the relevant parties and record these in the relevant section of the declaration form (see below). Where a personal relationship exists but either, there is no conflict of interest, or the conflict of interest has been resolved, the individuals must ensure that they demonstrate professional behaviour at all times and do not allow the personal relationship to influence their behaviour whilst at work. Similarly, if a personal relationship comes to an end, both parties must ensure that they continue to work professionally together and conduct themselves in an appropriate manner. Complaints made in this regard will be investigated in line with the appro priate procedure. Declaring Personal Relationships A member of staff who is involved in a personal relationship must notify their line manager or Head of Department/Service Leader/Centre Manager as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than a month from the start of the relationship. Where the manag er is involved in the personal relationship, they should declare this directly to their HR Partner via MyView/the relevant notification form (see below). Where relevant, personal relationships should also be declared in the annual Declaration of Interests survey (or via email to ethics@lse.ac.uk ). If the member of staff wishes to seek confidential advice before declaring a personal relationship, they can contact their HR Partner. This might include advice on whether the relationship is considered to fall under the remit of this procedure, the process that will be followed following a declaration, the possible options for managing a conflict of interest and the options should the other individual not wish to de clare the relationship. Once they have informed their manager or Head of Department /Service Leader/Centre Director, they 10 should complete the notification form on MyView, which will be provided to the relevant HR Partner. Alternatively, during the first t hree month s of the launch of the policy ( September 2021 to November 2021 inclusive ) declarations can be made using the notification form attached at Appendix A ; these should be submit ted to hr.partn ers.confidential@lse.ac.uk. Declarations will be treated respectfully, sensitively and confidentially and the notification form will be stored securely on the relevant HR file(s) and managed in accordance with data protection legislation. Failure to dis close a relevant personal relationship within the stipulated timeframe will be considered a disciplinary matter and could amount to a breach of trust. The onus to declare rests with the more senior staff member, though either party may declare the relation ship. In staff/student relationships, w hilst the responsibility for taking the above steps lies with the member of staff concerned, the student should report their relationship to another member of staff (e.g. Head of Department, if appropriate) or to the Deputy Head of Student Services (Advice & Policy), and request that the above steps be taken. If another member of staff or student is aware of such a relationship taking place, then they are also expected to report the situation to their Head of Department or to the Deputy Head of Student Services (Advice & Policy) or the Advis er to Women Students. The individual making the report should keep the details confidential, seeking advice as necessary and in line with this policy. Advice may be sought prior to doing so (see ‘Advice’ below). Reports will be treated confidentially and only discussed with relevant individuals in accordance with this procedure. Third parties making a report in good faith will not suffer detrimental treatment 6 as a result of their declaration. If they believe that they have suffered any such treatment, they should inform the Deputy Head of Student Services (Advice & Policy) or their HR Partner immediately. If the detrimental treatment is not remedied, the individual should raise it formally using the relevant staff grievance or student disciplinary procedure. Students who wish to seek advice on, or are concerned about reporting, a personal relationship may confidentially contact the Deputy Head of Student Services (Advice & Policy), the Advis er to Women Students or LSE Students’ Union Advice Centre. While students are advised to approach the Deputy Head of Student Services (Advice & Policy) or other individuals named here, it is ackn owledged that they may on occasion feel more comfortable approaching another member of staff within the department (academic or professional services). Advice can be sought on many different aspects including, for example, harassment, the impact of a relat ionship on a student’s studies and fear of bias or retribution. Transfer of information Subject to General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), w here an investigation into a staff member’s conduct is instigated and the staff member leaves before it is concluded, the School will consider the process for informing other employers about such investigations if the staff member is known to have applied for roles elsewhere7. Advice Staff can seek a dvice from their HR Partner or a trade union representative on the interpretation and application of this guidance. Students can seek advice from their academic advisor, the Head of Department or the Deputy Head of Student Services (Advice & Policy). 6 Detrimental treatment includes but is not limited to dismissal, disciplinar y action, threats or other unfavourable treatment 7 This is in line with emerging practice in the Higher Education sector. 11 Related policies and guidance papers • LSE Ethics Code • LSE Safeguarding Policy • LSE Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Policy • LSE Conflicts of Interest Policy • LSE Whistleblowing Policy • LSE Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy • Dignity at Work • Disciplinary and Dismissal Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff • Grievance Procedure for Professional Services Staff • The Academic Annex • Disciplinary Procedure for Students 12 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 1 year September 2022 May 2022 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 May 2020 School Management Committee Approved to take out for consultation 2 November 2020 JNICC Approved 3 August 2021 School Management Committee Approved Links Reference Link LSE Ethics Code https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/ethCod.pdf LSE Safeguarding Policy https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/safPol.pdf LSE Discrimination, H arassment and Bullying Policy https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/harPol.pdf LSE Conflicts of Interest Policy https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/conIntPol.pdf LSE Procedure for Considering Allegations of Harassment from Students Against Members of Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/proHarStu.pdf LSE Whistleblowing Policy https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/lsePubIntDisPro.pdf LSE Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/harVioPol.pdf Dignity at Work Statement https:// info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human - Resources/Wellbeing -Pages -2020/Professional - wellbeing Disciplinary and Dismissal Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human - Resources/Assets/Internal/staff/Policy/ PSSDisAndDi smissal.pdf Grievance Procedure for Professional Services Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/Services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/griPolProAcaSupSta.p df The Academic Annex https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedu res/Assets/Documents/acaAnn.pdf Disciplinary Procedure for Students https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/Services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/disProStu.pdf Contacts Position Name Email Notes Chief Operating Officer Andrew Young andrew.young@lse.ac.uk Sponsor 13 Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 Adoption Policy (including Surrogacy) 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE has a clear commitment to the promotion of equality of opportunity for all employees. It works towards positively supporting employees who are working parents and has attained a reputation as a top employer for working families. This policy demonstrates a commitment on the part of the School to enable employees to manage work and family. As part of this commitment, adoption leave and pay is available to all eligible employees within the diverse School community, including LGBT Q+, same -sex families and those who have a surrogacy arrangement. 1.2. The policy uses the following key terms: • Primary a dopter: the person who is eligible for adoption leave and/or pay. Primary a dopters may be male, female or trans (including individuals of non - binary identi ty). • Partner: the person who is the partner of the adopter. This can be a spouse, civil partner; or a partner who is living in an enduring relationship with the adopter and the child. Partners may be male, female or a trans individuals (including individuals of a non -binary identity) • Fostering to adopt : fostering a child permanently and becoming their legal parent 2. Policy aims 2.1. LSE seeks to sustain a strong track record as a diverse, fair and flexible employer that attracts and retains high calibre talent, and supports the career progression of its diverse staff community during their employment by the School. In keeping with that aim, this policy outlines LSE’s provision in respect of adoption leave and pay, as well as offering flexibility in how employees choose to manage their work and personal commitments during, and following, such a period of leave.2 3. Policy scope 3.1. This policy applies to all LSE employees of all grades who meet the eligibility criteria set out below. Access to contractual adoption leave and pay applies regardless of length of service, i.e., an employee may take such leave from their first day of employment with LSE. 4. Policy principles 4.1. Statutory Adoption Leave 4.1.1. The law entitles all employees who are adopting a child or fostering to adopt to: - 26 weeks’ ordinary adoption leave - 26 weeks’ additional adoption leave - the right to return to the same job held with the same terms and conditions, unless after additional adoption leave, this is not reasonably practicable. 4.1.2. Only one person in a couple can take adoption leave. The partner is able to apply for paternity leave. 4.1.3. Employees who are eligible for adoption leave have the right to paid time off work for up to five days’ to attend adoption appointments after they have been matched with a child. 4.1.4. Entitlement to statutory rights is dependent on the correct implementation of the procedures, as defined by legislation. 4.1.5. It should be noted that employees will only be entitled to adoption leave and pay when the child has been newly matched for adoption, i.e. this will not apply in circumstances where a step- parent adopts a partner’s child. 4.1.6. Adoption Leave is available to employees from the first date of their employment. 4.1.7. For adoptions within the UK, adoption leave can start on the date the child starts living with the employee or up to 14 days before the expected date of placement. 4.1.8. For overseas adoptions, the employee cannot start their adoption leave until the child has entered the UK. Adoption leave can start within 28 days of this date. 4.1.9. Employees in a surrogacy arrangement will be entitled to adoption leave and pay where they are actively attempting to obtain a parental or adoption order in respect of the child. 4.2. Statutory Adoption Payments (SAP) 4.2.1. The qualification period for SAP is 26 weeks of continuous service with the School up to any day in the week in which the primary adopter was matched with a child, 3 provided that normal weekly earnings at this point are not less than the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions for the eight week period ending with the week in which they were notified of being matched (More information can be found here )1. Entitlement to statutory rights is dependent on the correct implementation of the procedures, as defined by legislation. 4.2.2. SAP is paid for up to 39 weeks at 90% of gross average weekly earnings for the first six weeks followed by the rates given on https://www.gov.uk/adoption -pay- leave/pay or 90% of normal weekly earnings, whichever is lower. 4.2.3. Those employees who do not qualify for SAP may be able to receive financial support from their adoption agency or local Jo bcentre Plus Office. 4.3. Occupational Adoption Pay (OAP) 4.3.1. As part of the School’s positive support of employees who are working parents, Occupational Adoption Pay is available for eligible employees who are newly matched with a child for adoption and have agreed the date of placement with the adoption agency or have applied for a parental order in relation to a child born under a surrogacy agreement. Therefore, regardless of their length of service, employees are eligible for: • 22 weeks on full pay (this is inclusive of SAP for those who qualify) • 17 weeks of SAP or 90% of average weekly earnings, whichever is lower (subject to compliance with statutory conditions) • 13 weeks of unpaid leave. 4.4. Research Leave, New Academic Career Structure 4.4.1. Employees who are employed under the terms and conditions of the New Academic Career are entitled to a period of research leave following adoption leave to enable them to re -establish their research trajectory. Further details are available in the relevant review and promotion guidelines. 4.5. Neonatal Leave 4.5.1. In the case of premature birth2, in addition to the adoption leave provisions set out in section 4, qualifying employees are entitled to an additional period of leave paid at full pay (pro- rata for less than full -time employment). 4.5.2. An employee whose adopted baby is born prematurely is entitled to neonatal leave for every week (i.e., seven calendar days) that their baby is in neonatal care prior to the Expected Week of Childbirth (for a minimum of one week and up to a maximum of twelve weeks). In such circumst ances, adoption leave can be taken following the neonatal leave. 4.5.3. Employees who are eligible to take neonatal leave should notify their line manager 1 The requirements are the same for employ ees adopting from overseas and for employees in surrogacy arrangements, except they must have been continuously employed for at least 26 weeks at the start of the week when the pay will begin ( in case of overseas adoption) or 26 weeks up to any day in the 15th week before the baby is due (in case of surrogacy arrangements). 2 Including extremely pre -term (under 28 weeks), very pre -term (28 -31 weeks) and moderate pre -term (32- 36 weeks). 4 as soon as possible after the birth of the baby and subsequently confirm how many days their baby was in hospital ( neonatal leave notification form ). 5 Adoption Procedure 1. Introduction 1.1. This procedure provides information on the steps necessary to apply the Adoption Policy to the School’s eligible employees. It also includes ways in which employees will be supported prior to, during and following a period of adoption leave. 2. Time off for adoption appointments 2.1. Employees who are eligible for adoption leave have the right to paid time off work for up to five days’ to attend adoption appointments after they have been matched with a child. Should you wish to apply for pre- adoption leave, please speak to your line manager and HR Adviser. 3. Notification procedures 3.1. Please note that the notification procedures are a statutory obligation and therefore, eligibility to adoption pay may be affected where these are not complied with. 4. Notification of intention to take adoption leave 4.1. The manager must be informed, in writing, of the date on which placement is expected and the intended start date of the adoption leave period within seven days of either being matched with a child for adoption or the ado ption placement being confirmed, in the case of fostering to adopt, or as soon as reasonably practicable. 4.2. The leave may start when you have been matched with a child or up to 14 days before the actual placement. Any subsequent amendments to the intended start date should also be notified in writing with at least 28 days’ notice unless that is not reasonably practicable. A matching certificate from the adoption agency should be sent to the HR Adviser with a copy sent to the manager. 4.3. If placement occurs before the notified start date, the adoption leave will begin with the actual date of placement. 4.4. It is presumed that the full 52 weeks of leave will be taken by those who qualify unless notification is given of an earlier return; no separate notification for additional adoption leave is required. 4.5. Employees who qualify for statutory adoption leave should complete the SC6 form and return it to their HR Adviser. 5. Notification of return to work 5.1. By law all employees have the right to return to work after a period of adoption leave. The following procedures should be followed to ensure protection of both legislative and contractual rights. 6 5.2. If an individual takes the full entitlement to adoption leave of 52 weeks, this requires no notice of return to work. If return is intended before the end of the 52 weeks, eight weeks’ notice must be given in writing to the manager. If this notice is not given, the manager may postpone the return until 28 days have elapsed, or until the end of the relevant adoption leave period if that is earlier. 6. Transfer of adoption leave – Shared Parental Leave and Pay 6.1. If an employee proposes to return to work early, without using the full 52- week entitlement to adoption leave, they may be eligible to apply for Shared Parental Leave with their partner. For more information on this, please see the Shared Parental Leave Policy and Procedure. 7. Surrogacy 7.1. If an employee is having a child through a surrogacy arrangement, they may be entitled to adoption leave, pay and other rights where they apply to become the legal parent within six months of the child’s birth. 7.2. In case of surrogacy, employees will be entitled to adoption leave where they are actively attempting to obtain a parental or adoption order in respect of the child. If the employee does not actively attempt to obtain a parental or adoption order or if they cease doing so then leave will automatically end and the employee will be required to return to work. The employee should provide a copy of the final parental or adoption order once the order is granted. 7.3. As the intended parent, the employee has a statutory right to unpaid time off to attend two antenatal appointments with the person giving birth. The School recognises the importance of the intended parent being involved with the pregnancy and baby, and therefore offers paid time off to attend up to two antenatal appointments. If the employee is part of a couple, only one individual can accompany the person giving birth to the antenatal appointments. 7.4. The surrogate will be the child’s legal parent at birth. The employee must apply to become the legal parent within six months of the child’s birth to be entitled to adoption leave and pay. They must apply for : - A parental order if one intended parent is genetically related to the child - An adoption order if the intended parents are not genetically related to the child 7.5. If the employee appl ies for an adoption order, they will be eligible for adoption leave and pay. 7.6. If the employee appl ies or intends to apply for a parental order : - The employee should notify, in writing, no later than 15 th weeks before their baby is due, that they are having a baby through surrogacy, that they want to take adoption leave, when they want to take it and, where possible, should provide at least 28 days’ notice of the date that they wish to take adoption pay. As soon as reasonably practic able after the child’ s birth, the employee should also notify the date on which the child w as born. - For UK and overseas surrogacy arrangements, the employee can start 7 adoption leave from the date of birth or the day after the birth. - Employees may be asked to provide proof of surrogacy, by confirming in writing that they have applied or will apply for parental order within six months of the child’s birth. - In the case of premature birth, in addition to the adoption leave provisions set out in section 4, qualifying employees are entitled to an additional period of leave which is paid at full pay (pro -rata for less than full -time employment). An employee whose surrogate baby is born prematurely is entitled to neonatal leave for every week (i.e. seven days) that their baby is in neonatal care prior to the Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC), (for a minimum of one week and up to a maximum of 12 weeks). In such circ umstances, neonatal leave and pay will start immediately following the end of adoption leave. Employees who are eligible to take neonatal leave should notify their line manager as soon as possible after the birth of the baby and subsequently confirm how many days their baby was in hospital. 8. Adopting a child from overseas 8.1. For overseas adoptions, the adoption leave can start when the child arrives in the UK or on a predetermined date no more than 28 days after the child ’s arrival in the UK.. 8.2. The notification procedures for adopting a child from overseas are different from domestic adoption as there is no Matching Certificate. In place of this, individuals should submit the Official Notification, which confirms that the Certificate of Eligibility has been granted. Where a child is being adopted from abroad with a partner, the pay and leave declaration (SC6 form) must also be completed in order for the employee to receive adoption pay and to confirm they wil l not be taking paternity leave or pay. To make administration as easy as possible, the employee should discuss the timing of their adoption leave with the line manager as early as possible. The employee must give at least 28 days ’ notice in writing of their adoption leave date. 8.3. The employee should advise their manager of: - the date of receipt of official notification from the relevant UK authority of their eligibility to adopt a child from overseas - the date the child is expected to enter the UK. 8.4. Where the employee has completed 26 weeks’ continuous service at the time of receiving the official notification, the manager should be advised within 28 days of receipt of official notification. Where this is not the case, the individual should advise their line manager within 28 days of the Sunday of the week in which 26 weeks’ service is completed. 8.5. The employee should notify the line manager of the date that they wish the adoption leave to start at least 28 days beforehand unless this is not reasonably practicable. 8.6. The employee should also provide the line manager with evidence of the date on which the child enters the UK within 28 days of the child entering the UK, unless this is not reasonably practicable. The employee can choose to start their adoption leave either on the date that the child enters the UK or on a fixed date no later than 28 days later. 8 8.7. Once the employee becomes the legally adoptive parent of the child and can provide documentary evidence e.g. a certificate of adoption, should the line manager request this, the employee can request unpaid parental leave providing they meet the correct cri teria. Please see the parental leave webpage for further information. 9. Contact of Employment 9.1. During the period of adoption leave, the employee's contract of employment continues in force, and they are entitled to receive all their contractual benefits, except for salary. In particular, their contractual holiday entitlement will continue to accrue. 9.2. Pension contributions will continue to be made during any period when the employee is receiving adoption leave but not during any period of unpaid adoption leave. Employee contributions will be based on actual pay, while the School’s contributions will be based on the salary that the employee would have received had they not been taking adoption leave. Should the employee wish, they can make additional contributions during their period of unpaid leave upon returning and if they decide to do this, the School will also make contributions in accordance with the pension scheme rules. Subsequent awards of backdated salary, which take effect during the calculation period used to work out adoption pay, will lead to a recalculation of the amount payable. 9.3. Return to the job in which an individual was employed under the original contract of employment and on the same terms and conditions is automatic following the statutory period of 26 weeks. However, if more than 26 weeks have been taken and it is not reasonably practicable for a return to the same job then suitable alternative work with the same status and on terms and conditions which are no less favourable than the original job may be offered. 10. Contact during adoption leave 10.1. Before an employee's adoption leave begins, the line manager and the employee should discuss arrangements for keeping in touch during the leave. The School reserves the right, in any event, to maintain reasonable contact with employees from time to time during their adoption leave. This may be for example, to ensure the individual is aware of any possible vacancies or promotion opportunities, to discuss any special arrangements to be made or training to be given to ease their return to work, to discuss how their holiday accrual might be taken upon their return or simply to update them on developments at work during their absence. 11. 'Keeping in Touch' (KIT) days 11.1. Whilst on adoption leave, individuals may either request, or be requested to undertake up to ten days’ paid work under their contract of employment. 'Keeping in Touch' (KIT) days may be taken at any stage during the adoption leave period. 11.2. The type of work that an individual undertakes on a KIT day is a matter for agreement between the individual and their manager. Subject to mutual agreement, 9 keeping in touch days may be used for any activity that would ordinarily be classed as work under an individual’s contract, i.e. to undertake an important work -related training activity or to enable an individual to attend an important team meeting or conference. 11.3. Work during the adoption leave period may take place only by agreement between both an individual and their manager. A manager may not insist that an individual works during the adoption leave period if they do not wish to do so, nor does an individual hav e the right to a KIT day if their manager does not agree to it. 11.4. If a manager requests that an employee works a KIT day, the individual is entitled to turn the opportunity down without suffering any consequences as a result. It is unlawful for an individual to suffer detriment for not agreeing to work keeping in touch days, or for requesting to work KIT days. 11.5. Where a disagreement arises in respect of KIT days either about the principle of taking such days or the schedule of how the days are to be taken, the manager and the employee should try to resolve the disagreement as informally and quickly as possible. 11.6. Throughout the process, managers should seek advice from their HR Adviser concerning any related queries that they may have. 11.7. KIT days are paid by the hour at the individual's standard hourly rate. On a KIT day an individual should work no more than their normal working hours set out in their appointment letter or agreed with their line manager. Any work carried out under an individual’s contract on any day will count as a whole KIT day. For example, if an individual attends work only for a one -hour training session, they will have used one of their KIT days. Undertaking work on a KIT day will not affect an individual’s adoption p ay entitlement. 11.8. To be paid for KIT days worked, the KIT day form should be completed by both the employee and line manager and returned to their HR Adviser. This should be received by the payroll deadline of the month in which the KIT day was worked or, if this is not possible, the following month. Payment will be made at the end of the month in which the form was received. 12. Use of accrued holiday entitlement 12.1. An employee’s holiday entitlement (including annual leave, closure days and bank holidays) will be accrued during the whole leave period. Where, on return to work, either the employee is unable, or it is not operationally possible for them, to take all their accrued holiday, the untaken leave can be carried over into the following year. 12.2. Employees should discuss how they wish to take the holiday entitlement that they will accrue whilst on adoption leave with their line manager, ideally before the employee starts the aforementioned leave. As with any annual leave request, this must be agreed by the line manager. The possible options to discuss with the line manager include taking a block of 10 accrued leave before returning to work or using accrued leave to allow a phased return to work by working shorter working weeks for a fixed period. 12.3. In the event of an individual not returning to work following the period of adoption leave due to resignation, payment in lieu of holiday calculated up to the last working day and not taken before the start of the adoption leave will be given. 13. Non-renewal of fixed term contracts 13.1. Non-renewal of fixed- term contracts due to adoption leave is discriminatory. Fixed- term contracts should be renewed if the work or funding is continuing. Where work or funding is not continuing procedural advice should be sought from their HR Partner. 14. Redundancy 14.1. Employees on adoption leave have special protection in a redundancy situation. In particular, they will be given priority ahead of other colleagues in being offered suitable alternative vacancies. 14.2. Managers should, therefore, ens ure that HR is made aware of employees who are at risk of redundancy whilst on adoption leave so that relevant advice can be provided. 14.3. An individual on adoption leave can be made redundant where there is a genuine redundancy situation at that time that is not connected to the adoption leave. As with all redundancies, the correct procedure must be followed and the normal rules relating to redundancies applied, including consultation with the employee. 15. Returning to work after adoption leave 15.1. Following the end of adoption leave, the employee is expected to return on the next working day, unless an additional period of annual leave has been agreed or they notify the School otherwise. 15.2. If the employee is unable to attend work at the end of adoption leave due to sickness, the School’s normal arrangements, including notification procedures, for sickness absence will apply. 15.3. Failure to return on the due date after the adoption leave expires will be regarded as unauthorised absence and may be treated as a disciplinary matter. 15.4. If, after the adoption leave begins, a decision is made not to return to work, the normal contractual period of notice must be given, in writing. 11 15.5. LSE has a range of resources to support disabled staff, including reasonable adjustments and other measures set out in the Disability Policy. In addition to pre- existing disabilities, it is recognised that adopters may also develop and suffer from mental health conditions relating to adoption (such as post -adoptive depression) that can in some cases amount to a disability. In all situations, staff and managers are encouraged to seek further advice and support as appropriate, which may include their HR Partn er, Staff Counselling, or the EAP. 16. Further information and advice 16.1. The policy and procedure are intended to outline entitlements to statutory and contractual adoption rights; all employees who wish to or are considerin g apply for adoption leave and pay should also contact their HR Advis er for more specific advice. Information regarding paternity /partner’s leave can be found on the Paternity /Partner’s Leave Policy webpage. 16.2. It is recognised that surrogacy and adoption can be difficult process es and employees may wish to access support, such as staff counselling, EAP, etc. HR Advisers can provide further informati on.12 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 September 2026 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 November 2017 JNICC 2 January 2023 JNICC Links Reference Link Contacts Position Name Email Notes HR Policy Adviser Elisabetta Viotto e.viotto@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': '1 1. Scope This policy sets out a framework for managers to manage redeployment in a fair and effective manner, in line with the School’s policy statement on equality and diversity and good employer practice. The Redeployment Policy and the associated Procedure are not contractual and may be amended by the School from time to time. 2. Principles a) It is the School’s policy to offer r edeployment wherever possible and in line with the School’s strategic priorities in order not to dismiss employees on grounds of redundancy or when an employee becomes disabled and unable to perform the basic tasks of their job. b) Redeployment is defined as the transfer of an employee to a suitable alternative post within the School. The post should have a job specification that the employee can match in terms of competencies either immediately or with training in a reasonable timescale, which would norma lly be within four weeks. c) The School is committed to recruiting, developing and, wherever possible, retaining high quality employees. Therefore, employees may be eligible for redeployment in the following circumstances: • for the purpose of avoiding comp ulsory redundancy as a result of an organisational restructure • where a fixed term contract is due to expire and the employee is at risk of dismissal on the grounds of redundancy • where an employee becomes disabled and redeployment is considered a reasonable step Competitive application for redeployment may be required for i) and ii) above. However, in line Redeployment Policy and Procedure Operational 2 with the statutory position and case law: • employees on maternity or adoptive leave, or additional paternity leave whose posts are at risk of redundancy or who are being made redundant, must be offered a suitable alternative post in preference to any other redeployee and • in the case of redeployment of a disabled employee, there should not be a competitive interview. Confirmation of redeployment is dependent on the capability of the person to carry out the work and the practicality and reasonableness of any necessary reasonable adjustments. d) Responsibility for redeployment lies initially with the relevant Head of Department, Research Centre Director or Serv ice Leader and every effort should be made within the department or division to find a suitable alternative position for the employee(s) within the department or service. If there is no suitable employment within the department or division, the Head of Department, Research Centre Director or Service Leader should inform their HR Partner and request that the employee be placed on the Redeployment Register so that recruiting managers elsewhere in the School can give priority consideration to the employee, tak ing into account the employee’s performance at interview. 3. Further support Managers and employees are encouraged to seek further clarification and advice on the policy from their HR Partner and information on the Redeployment Register from HR Services. T he trade unions recognised by the School are also available to provide support to their members. This policy was adopted on 20th September 2013 following consultation with the recognised trade unions: UCU, UNISON and UNITE and discussion with the Director’ s Management Team. 3 London School of Economics and Political Science Redeployment Procedure 1. Scope This procedure applies to all staff employed on a permanent or fixed term contract of employment with the School. The procedure and the associated policy are not contractual and may be amended by the School from time to time. a) Employees may be eligible for redeployment in the following circumstances: • for the purpose of avoiding compulsory redundancy as a result of an organisational restructure • where a fi xed term contract, or specific external funding supporting continued employment is due to expire and the employee is at risk of dismissal on the grounds of redundancy • where an employee becomes disabled to the extent that remaining in the current job is no longer possible and redeployment is considered a reasonable step to enable continuing employment. The redeployment procedure does not apply to employees who are seeking a new job or change of career or provide cover for other staff on maternity leave, sick ness absence or other leave. Also, the procedure does not apply to LSE Fellows or academic visitors or interns. b) The Redeployment procedure should be read in conjunction with the following procedures and funding initiatives: • the guidance on Managing staf f on fixed term contracts guidance where redeployment is requested because of the expiry of a fixed term contract • the guidance on Managing staff on open -ended contracts subject to continued availability of specific funding guidance where redeployment is re quested because of the end of specific funding for the contract the Capability Health procedure where redeployment is required as a reasonable step for a disabled employee • the LSE Bridging Fund Scheme which enables Principal Investigators to retain individ ual researchers where they are important to the successful delivery of secured grants • the Research Committee Seed Fund which assists individuals and groups to secure large scale funding bids. 2. Analysis of the effects on equality An analysis of the effect s on equality needs has been carried out to check that the procedure does not adversely affect employees on the grounds of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexu al orientation. 3. Principles 4 a) The aim of the School’s Redeployment procedure is to provide a fair process to manage the redeployment of employees who are either at risk of dismissal because of redundancy or expiry of a fixed term contract or become dis abled and, as a result, are no longer able to continue working in their current posts. To support the procedure, a Redeployment Register which is managed by HR Division provides a centralised resource to retain existing employees who are not offered redepl oyment within their department, division or research centre. b) Redeployment is defined as the transfer of an employee to a suitable alternative post within the School. Suitable alternative work is work that the employee can reasonably be expected to do, taking into account their seniority and skills either immediately or with training in a reasonable timescale, e.g. for academic support posts the time period the timescale would normally be within four weeks for academic or research posts the timescale wou ld normally be much longer. It is work that is the same as or not substantially different from the previous work. The following criteria will be used to determine the suitability of alternative employment: • i. banding and pay • ii. qualifications, knowledge, skills and experience required to carry out the work • iii. working hours • iv. status • v. type of work • vi. location Work may still be regarded as suitable even if a reasonable period of training is necessary. c) Wherever possible, the redeployment will be wit hin the employee’s existing department, division or research centre. d) In terms of salary, any decisions must take equal pay implications into account. Where an employee chooses to accept a transfer to a post at a lower banding the terms and conditions of employment should, where possible and within the control of the School, remain the same. Where the top of lower banding, including the contribution range is less than the employee’s current salary, consideration will be given to protecting the employee’s pay for a maximum of twelve months, following which period the salary will be reduced to the top of the lower banding on a phased basis of no more than twelve calendar months. For the avoidance of doubt, this would entail monthly equal reductions in basic salary from the employee’s previous salary to the top of the relevant contribution zone for the new role As for the pension implications of any changes in salary, the employee is advised to contact the Pensions Team, HR Division before making any decision to accept the lower banding. Pension matters are restricted by the Rules of the pension schemes. e) Where an employee is offered suitable employment in terms of the criteria as outlined in paragraph 3b and decides not to accept the post, the employee sho uld outline in writing to their current manager why they do not consider the post to be suitable. Where it is agreed that the post is unsuitable, the employee may remain on the Redeployment Register. Where after consideration of the employee’s account and the criteria in paragraph 3b), it is not agreed that the post is unsuitable, the employee may forfeit the right to any redundancy payment. 4. Redeployment within the School a) In line with the statutory position and case law an employee on maternity or ado ption leave or additional paternity leave, whose post is at risk of redundancy or who is being made redundant must automatically be offered, not just invited to apply for, a vacancy that is suitable for the employee. The offer must be made to the employee in preference to any other 5 employee who is not on maternity or adoption leave or additional paternity leave but whose job is also redundant, even if the other employee is better qualified for the position. Also in line with case law, where an employee’s di sability means that it is no longer possible to remain in the same job, a reasonable adjustment may be a transfer without competitive interview to a job that the employee can do. Examples of reasonable adjustments are given in the Equality Act 2010 Code of Practice, Employment Statutory Code of Practice. b) The responsibility for redeployment lies with the Head of Department, Research Centre Director or Service Leader in whose area the employee is currently employed and they remain responsible for the sala ry and management of the employee until alternative employment is confirmed or the conclusion of the School’s procedures is reached. Departments undergoing restructuring are not expected to give prior consideration to employees on the Redeployment Register from other departments whilst their own restructuring is in process. Trade unions are available to provide support to their members. c) The timescale for eligible employees to be placed on the Redeployment Register is a maximum of three months, at the en d of which the possible outcomes are acceptance of alternative employment or confirmation of redundancy. The period is defined as the Redeployment Period and the steps in the process are outlined below: • i. Stage 1 Every effort must be made within the department, division or research centre to find an alternative position, in line with the School’s strategic priorities, for which the employee is suitable. If suitable employment can be found within the department or division, the Head of Department, Rese arch Centre Director or Service Leader should meet with the employee to make the offer and should confirm the offer in writing with, if appropriate, information on developmental support or reasonable adjustments. Following acceptance by the employee, a rev ised contract letter should be issued and sent to the employee for acceptance and return of a signed copy. If appropriate, the letter will also refer to the start and end date of a trial period (paragraph 5 refers). Receipt of the signed letter ends the pr ocess of redeployment. • ii. Stage 2 If it is not possible to offer a suitable alternative position to the employee, then the Head of Department, Research Centre Director or Service Leader should meet with the employee to discuss and identify the employee’s relevant experience, skills, qualifications and preferred work options and/or departments. The outcome of the meeting should be a completion or updating by the employee of a CV and a record of expressed preferences in terms of type of work and/or departmen ts, which is sent to HR Division to be placed on the Redeployment Register to enable recruiting managers elsewhere in the School to give priority consideration to the employee on the Redeployment Register before considering other applicants. Prior consider ation involves considering the employee against the person specification for the vacant post in order for a match with the essential criteria for the post.to match. Once a match has been established then the employee will be offered an interview prior to a ny other candidates (except for other redeployees). If the employee proves suitable at interview they should be offered the post • iii. Stage 3 If paragraph 4a) applies, i.e. the employee, who is on maternity or adoptive leave or additional paternity leave a nd who is at risk of redundancy, matches the person specification the recruiting manager should automatically offer the post to the employee. A meeting may be arranged by the recruiting manager to discuss the appropriateness of the job for the employee. Wh ere an employee’s disability means that it is no longer possible to remain in the same job, a reasonable adjustment may be a transfer without competitive interview to a job that the employee can do; in such a case 6 a meeting may be arranged by the recruitin g manager to discuss any reasonable adjustments before an offer is made. • iv. Following acceptance by the employee, a revised contract letter should be issued and sent to the employee for acceptance and return of a signed copy. Receipt of the signed letter ends the process of redeployment. • v. If paragraph 4a) does not apply, the recruiting manager should use the normal recruitment selection procedures for example, holding a selection committee to give the employee the opportunity to demonstrate their suitabi lity for the post, following which either, a revised contract letter should be issued and sent to the employee for acceptance and return of a signed copy or, the redeployee remains on the Redeployment Register. • vi. Stage 4 If it is not possible through this procedure to offer alternative employment for an employee at risk of redundancy then the redundancy notice periods shall run concurrently with the redeployment period. Where it is not possible through this Redeployment Policy and Procedure to offer alter native employment for an employee who has become disabled, the Capability – Health procedure applies. 5. Trial periods a) Where for the purpose of avoiding compulsory redundancy an employee is offered and accepts an alternative post, which means a change in the contract there is an entitlement to a statutory trial period of four weeks beginning on the day the employee starts the new position. The purpose of the trial period is for both the manager and the employee to establish and agree whether or not the job is in fact suitable in terms of the competencies required of the employee and any change in terms and conditions. The manager and the employee may agree in writing to extend the trial period for a reasonable length of time beyond the statutory four weeks if the new job requires the employee to be retrained. Before the trail period begins, the recruiting manager should set out a clear and reasonable statement of performance standards and objectives to be met and support to be provided during the trial pe riod. During the trial period, the manager and employee should regularly review the progress of the redeployment and discuss any training or support to facilitate a successful outcome. If the employee resigns, or gives notice, during the trial period for a ny reason, then the original dismissal will deemed to stand; the reasonableness of a refusal of suitable alternative work and whether a redundancy payment is payable will depend on the individual circumstances and perception of the employee.. Similarly, if the employee is dismissed for a reason relating to the differences between the old and new jobs, the date of dismissal is the date on which the original contract came to an end. b) In the case of the redeployment of a disabled employee, it is the School’ s policy to offer a trial period the duration of which will depend on the circumstances of the case, normally up to three months. During the trial period, the manager and employee should regularly review the progress of the redeployment and discuss any tra ining or support to facilitate a successful outcome. Where the trial period is not successful, the capability -health process may be used to consider further options. 6. Further support a) Managers and employees are encouraged to seek further clarification and advice on the policy from their HR Partner. b) Employees may also find it helpful to seek support from one of the School networks. The School currently has the following groups: EMBRACE (Black and Ethnic Minority Staff Network), SPECTRUM (Lesbian, Ga y, Bisexual and Transgender Staff Network), Gender 7 Equality Forum, Disabled Staff Network, Parents and Parents -to-be Network and Network for Carers of Adults. This policy was adopted on 20th September 2013 following consultation with the recognised trade u nions: UCU, UNISON and UNITE and discussion with the Director’s Management Team.

       "  'text': \"1 Introduction LSE (‘the School’) aims to attract, recruit and retain the highest quality staff. As part of this commitment, the School promotes and encourages the appropriate use of responsibility allowances. This p olicy sets out the School ’s position on responsibility allowances and the principles that apply to them. Employees are paid in line with the terms set out in their contract of employment (including any subsequent amendments made to their contract). With the exception of some members of the School’s Management Committee, all professional services staff employed by the School are paid a basic salary on the LSE single pay spine. The School acknowledges that using existing skills of staff can be beneficial - and often necessary - in achieving the School’s strategic priorities and, as such, should be encouraged where appropriate. Where a member of staff is occasionally required to take on additional temporary responsibilities that fall outside their main contractual duties, a responsibility allowance may be an appropriate means of recognising this contribution beyond the individual’s substantive role. However, there can be instances where an employee can take on additional responsibilities within their job description which would not require any additional remuneration, for example when an employee exchanges responsibilities or elements of their job description on a temporary basis. Other School policies and guidance related to responsibility allowances are: • LSE Ethics Code (in particular those sections related to Equality of Opportunity and Integrity) • Secondment Policy • Additional Payments Policy • Financial Regulations • Contribution Pay Guidance The term 'responsibility allowance’ is used to reflect the reward of a significant and temporary increase in an individual’s responsibilities. Profe ssional Services Staff Responsibility Allowance Policy & Procedure Operational 2 Policy scope This policy is intended to apply to all professional services roles. It is, however, n ot intended that senior staff whose pay decisions are determined by Remuneration Committee, on the recommendation of the Director, are covered by this p olicy. Staff who are under formal performance review will not normally be considered for an additional responsibility allowance. Policy aims This policy aims to ensure that responsibility allowances are determined within a robust framework that offers financial assurance, transparency, fairness, equity, value for money and procedural compliance. The policy will aid managers to reward and develop an employee’s skills and knowledge, enhanc e organisational effectiveness and offer a way to ‘plug’ short and medium -term skills gaps. Policy principles Responsibility allowances are paid to staff to support temporary business needs. In addition, they promote career development opportunities that provide additional means of career advancement. They allow the School to make full use of the skills and experience ac ross the School and offer a solution to time limited skills gaps. Managers are reminded that, as per all professional services staff job descriptions, some flexibility is expected in all roles. Responsibility allowances are only suitable for significant c hanges in roles. Managers should carefully consider the suitability of the staff being given the additional responsibilities to ensure that any additional responsibilities do not impact the proper performance of the employee’s substantive contractual resp onsibilities. Payment of a responsibility allowance should not result in staff being required to work excessive additional hours above their contracted hours. When considering payment of responsibility allowances, m anagers should also carefully consider the suitability of staff in respect of ensuring that fairness and equality of opportunity is provided within the workplace. It is expected that managers will have carefully c onsidered all staff eligible to determi ne the most suitable member(s) of staff to be given an additional responsibility allowances. Reasonable explanation as to why specific staff were selected will be required. Equality data will be monitored as part of regular Equality Impact Assessments. Respo nsibility allowances are paid for a defined period of time which may subsequently be extended, where appropriate. Responsibility allowances will normally apply between 1 to 12 months in total, inclusive of any extensions. Responsibility allowances of a longer duration will only be approved in exceptional circumstances with the review and approval of t he Chief Operating Officer with support from the Human Resources Division. 3 Managers should also consider the impact, development and motivation of staff once a responsibility allowance has come to an end. It is advisable for managers to have progress meetings during the period of additional responsibilities. Appropriate responsibility allowances Before approving a responsibility allowance, consideration should be given to whether it is the most appropriate method of payment for taking on additional responsibilities. As a general guide, the following do not constitute additional responsibilities: • Increase in demand of “business as usual” work • Covering short -term annual leave of colleagues • Exceptional performance in role • When taking on some additional duties at the same grade within the flexibility of the job description. • Taking on career development opportunities which are not a requirement of the role Rates o f payment framework It is expected that managers will offer responsibility allowances up to a total value of 10 percent of basic pay. This may be offered normally in the form of temporary increment al increases, fixed monthly payments or percentage pay allowances for the period in which the member of staff takes on the additional responsibilities. Managers may sometimes feel under pressure to meet the salary expectations of staff to agree to take on additional responsibilities. It is advised that in such circumstances, a manager takes time to consider other possible options and discuss the matter with their Head of Department/Service Division and/or their HR Partner/HR Adviser before any verbal offer is made. It is recognised, however, that some flexibility may occasionally be necessary in order to attract staff to take on additional responsibilities. In such cases, it will be expected that managers will select an appropriate level of additional remuneration, taking the following into account: • The skills and ability of the members of staff required to take on additional responsibilities whilst maintaining appropriate levels of performance and workload in their substantive role. • The nature of the additional re sponsibilities. • Managers need to ensure they consider the salaries of existing comparable staff against the members of staff being offered an additional responsibility allowance. Heads of Department/Service Divisions will be responsible for ensuring that these considerations are carried out consistently and that managers follow the local practices. Further information on setting appropriate levels of remuneration for responsibility allowances is provided in the supplementary guidance documen t. 4 Financial Considerations and Ethics Code As per the School’s Financial Regulations, budget controllers are responsible to Finance Committee and Council for operating within budgets and managing budgets in accordance with financial procedures. Responsibility allowances will not normally be backdated. For all approved cases, employees will receiv e a contractual letter before any additional responsibilities are taken on. In accordance with the School’s Ethics Code, the School requires members of the LSE community to act in accordance with the principles of Responsibility and Accountability, Integr ity and Equality of Respect and Opportunity in the awarding and management of responsibility allowances. Agreement HRMB and JNICC 5 Responsibility Allowance Procedure The purpose of this procedure is to set out the framework for requesting and approving responsibility allowances, as well as the levels of remuneration to apply during periods of additional responsibilities. Requirements and Conditions This procedure applies to all professional services staff where the payment does not form part of the employee’s contractual obligations and/or is covered under an appropriate School payment policy. All proposals must be submitted and approved before the start of the additional responsibilities. If approval has not been granted, including signed acceptance from the employee, before the proposed start da te of an additional responsibility allowance, the start date will be postponed until the required approval has been granted. Roles and responsibilities - The manager/department is responsible for: o Decid ing whether additional responsibilities fall within the scope of this policy and, therefore, whether a request for an additional responsibility allowance should be made prior to work commencing. o Consult ing with the relevant HR Partner on the use of responsibi lity allowances. o Submitting a completed responsibility allowance request form to HR. o Securing appropriate fund checks from Finance Division. o Acting in line with the Ethics code. - The employee is responsible for: o Ensuring that any additional responsibilities taken on are compliant with their Right to Work. For example, student visas in many cases restrict the hours per week that may be worked. - Human Resources Division is responsible for: o Provid ing guidance and advice on additional payments to managers and departments. o Review ing and process ing submitted cases. For all agreed cases, HR will provide the employee with a contract amendment letter for the responsibility allowance. - Finance Division are responsible for: o Providing appropriate fund che cks where appropriate under Financial Regulations. Setting and documenting responsibility allowances Roles at s alary bands 1 -8 Managers have the discretion to approve a responsibility allowance up to a total salary level of 10 percent of a member of staff’s basic salary. Options and structures are provided in the policy and guidance document. Managers will be required to document the rationale for responsibility allowances by completing and submitting the responsibility allowance form to Human Resources 6 Division. As a general rule of thumb, the higher the responsibility allowance the manager intends to offer, the more comprehensive the rationale and evidence expected. Managers seeking to exceptionally approve a responsibility allowance above a total value of 10 percent of the member of staff’s basic pay will require prior approval from their HR Partner and the Director of HR. Managers will be required to document the reasons for the responsibility allowance in the previously discussed form. This is also the case for extension requests in excess of 12 months up to a maximum of 14 months. Senior professional services staff roles, salary bands 9 -10 Senior professional services staff at bands 9 and above are considered to have significant Scho ol- wide impact. Any responsibility allowance at these levels should be considered across other comparable professional services staff across the School and not just within individual departments, divisions, ce ntres and institutes. Responsibility allowances for all b and 9 and 10 staff will require prior approval from t he Chief Operating Officer and Director of Human Resources in consultation wi th the relevant HR Partner. Managers will be required to document the reasons for the responsibility allowance in the form provided on the HR website. The Chief Operating Officer and Director of Human Resources will be provided with the following infor mation to inform the responsibility allowance proposal: 1. Comparable salary data for internal staff with equality analysis 2. External benchmarking salary data. Senior professional services staff roles reporting to the Director The Remuneration Committee will receive and approve responsibility allowance recommen dations from the Director for senior professional services staff reporting to the Director. The Director’s proposals will be informed by: 1. Comparable salary data for internal staff with equality analysis 2. External salary benchmarking data 3. The Good Pay Guide for Charities and Social Enterprises dated December 2013 4. Compliance with relevant School guidance on best practice principles for salary setting, specifically applying to senior pay. Summary approval table below: Staff levels Approval required Salary bands 1 -8 – Up to 10 percent of basic salary Manager approval Salary bands 1 -8 – Above 10 percent HR Partner approval and the Director of HR Salary bands 9 -10 (all cases) Approved by the Chief Operating Officer and Director of HR Professional services staff reporting to the Director Director’s proposal approved by Remuneration Committee 7 Monitoring of responsibility allowances The HR Divisio n will monitor responsibility allowances on an annual basis, ensur ing that the impact of such decisions, including regular Equality Impact Assessments is understood by the School.

       "  'text': \"1 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE has a clear commitment to the promotion of equality of opportunity for all employees. It works towards positively supporting employees who are working parents and has attained a reputation as a top university for working families. This policy demonstrates a commitment on the part of the School to enable employees to manage work and family. As part of this commitment, maternity leave and pay is available to all eligible employees within the diverse LSE community, including LGBT Q+, same -sex families and tho se involved in a surrogacy arrangement. 1.2. The policy uses the following key terms: • mother: the individual who gives birth to a child • partner: the child’s biological father or the partner of the mother. This can be a spouse, civil partner; or a partner who is living in an enduring relationship with the mother and the child. Partners may be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non -binary identity). • EWC: expect ed week of childbirth/notification week. It is the week, beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday, in which the baby is expected to be born. • AWE: average weekly earnings. 2. Policy aims 2.1. The School seeks to sustain a strong track record as a diverse, fair and flexible employer that attracts and retains high calibre talent, and sup ports the career progression of its diverse staff community during their employment by the School. Maternity Leave Policy Operational 2 3. Policy principles 3.1. The law entitles all employees who are pregnant to: • paid time off to attend antenatal care • a period of maternity leave • the right to return to the same job held before the start of the maternity leave with the same terms and conditions, unless, after additional maternity leave, this is not reasonably practicable. 3.2. Most employees will also qualify for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) or Maternity Allowance (MA) (see the statutory maternity payments section below). 3.3. Entitlement to statutory rights is dependent on the correct implementation of the procedures as defined by legislation. 3.4. Immediately following the date of childbirth, there is a compulsory period of two weeks ’ maternity leave during which employees are prohibited from working or being permitted by the employer to work. 3.5. Employees also have the right not to be subjected to detrimental treatment on grounds of pregnancy, childbirth, maternity or suspension on hea lth and safety grounds. 3.6. This policy and procedure are intended to outline entitlements to statutory and contractual maternity leave and pay. 3.7. This policy also sets out the additional provisions and entitlements for employees whose baby is born prematurely and needs neonatal care. 4. Time off for antenatal care 4.1. There is an entitlement, regardless of the length of service or the number of hours worked, to paid time off during working hours to receive antenatal care on the advice of their doctor, midwife, or health visitor. 4.2. Antenatal care is not restricted to medical examinations. It could, for example, include relaxation classes and parentcraft classes where these are advised by a registered medical practitioner, registered midwife or registered health visitor. 3 5. Fertility treatments 5.1. Whilst there is no statutory right to time off work for fertility treatments (such as in vitrio fertilisation (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) etc.), the School recognises that the process can be extremely stressful for employees. 5.2. Employees who a re undergoing fertility treatments should discuss arrangements with their line manager and managers are encouraged to demonstrate flexibility regarding how related appointments can be accommodated where possible. If an employee is off sick due to the side effects of a fertility treatment, the usual provisions under the sickness absence procedure should be followed. 5.3. Employees and managers should also be aware of the sources of support available in the School during periods of fertility treatment, including staff counselling and the EAP. 6. Statutory maternity leave entitlements 6.1. All pregnant employees are entitled to take up to one year (52 weeks) of maternity leave, regardless of their length of service. Maternity leave is a single continuous period and is made up of 26 weeks’ Ordinary Maternity Leave and 26 weeks’ Additional Mat ernity leave. Please note that different terms and conditions apply during these two leave periods. Such provisions are outlined below and included in the ‘maternity leave’ section in the Terms and Conditions of employment. 6.2. This leave can start at any p oint from the 11th week before the Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC), up to the actual date of birth. However, it is advisable for the employee to commence their maternity leave no later than the date on which the baby is due. 7. Statutory maternity pay (SMP ) 7.1. The qualification period for SMP is 26 weeks’ continuous service with the School in the 15th week before the Expected Week of Childbirth ( EWC ), provided that average weekly earnings at this point are not less than the lower earnings limit for NI contributions (the rates can be found here). This is subject to pregnancy continuing until birth or having occurred by the 11th week before the EWC. 7.2. SMP is paid for up to 39 weeks of which: • the first 6 weeks are paid at 90% of average weekly earnings; and • the following 33 weeks are paid at a fixed rate per week (information is provided on: www.gov.uk/rates -and-thresholds -for-employers -2014 -to-2015 ) or 90% of average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. 4 8. Occupational maternity pay (OMP) 8.1. It is the School's policy to support pregnant emplo yees and new mothers by paying enhanced contractual maternity pay and to provide a contact in Human Resources for advice regarding entitlements and procedures. All employees, regardless of their length of service, qualify for occupational maternity pay (OMP), which is paid as : • 22 weeks of leave on full pay (this is inclusive of SMP for those who qualify) • 17 weeks of SMP or 90% of average weekly earnings, whichever is lower (subject to compliance with statutory conditions) • 13 weeks of unpaid leave. 8.2. A contract of employment must be in existence during the weeks where OMP is to be paid. Where a contract of employment ends, OMP will be paid up to and including the last day of the contract and any remaining weeks of paid maternity leave will be paid at the SMP rate, if the employee qualifies for SMP. 9. Research Leave, New Academic Career Structure 9.1. Employees who are employed under the terms and conditions of the New Academic Career are entitled to a period of research leave following maternity leave to enable them to re-establish their research trajectory. Further details are available in the relevant review and promotion guidelines. 10. Neonatal Leave and Pay 10.1. In the case of premature birth1, in addition to the maternity leave provisions set out in section 8, qualifying employees are entitled to an additional period of leave which is paid at full pay (pro-rata for less than full -time employment). 10.2. An employee whose baby is born prematurely is entitled to neonatal leave for every week (i.e. seven days) that their baby is in neonatal care prior to the Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC), (for a minimum of one week and up to a maximum of 12 weeks ). In such circumstances, neonatal leave and pay will start immediately following the end of maternity leave. 10.3. Employees who are eligible to take neonatal leave should notify their line manager as soon as possible after the birth of the baby and subsequently confirm how many days their baby was in hospital (neonatal leave notification form ). 1 Including extremely pre -term (under 28 weeks), very pre -term (28 -31 weeks) and moderate pre -term (32 -36 weeks). 5 Maternity Leave Procedure 1. Introduction 1.1. This procedure provides information on the steps necessary to apply the policy on maternity leave to LSE employees. The procedure also includes ways in which employees will be supported prior to, during and following a period of maternity leave. 2. Antenatal appointments 2.1. Employees should give managers as much notice as possible for paid time off to attend appointments. F or second and subsequent appointments, a certificate from the employee's GP, registered midwife, or registered health visitor, with confirmation of pregnancy may be asked for by the manager. The manager may also ask for an appointment card or other evidenc e of the appointment. 3. Notification procedures 3.1. The notification procedures are a statutory obligation and therefore, in cases where these are not complied with, it may affect payment of maternity pay. 4. Notification of pregnancy and intention to take matern ity leave 4.1. By the end of the 15th week before the EWC, the manager must be given notice, in writing, that the employee is pregnant, their expected date of childbirth and the intended start date of maternity leave. 4.2. The maternity leave period may start on the 11th we ek before the EWC up until the expected date of childbirth. Any subsequent change to the intended start date should also be notified in writing 28 days before the original or new date, whichever is earlier. 4.3. The MAT B1 certificate, which is a form confirm ing the expected date of childbirth can be obtained from a GP/Midwife approximately 20 weeks prior to the EWC and should be sent to the HR Adviser, with a copy sent to the manager. 4.4. If childbirth occurs before the notified start date, then the maternity leave will begin on the day after childbirth. The manager should be notified in writing within 28 days of the childbirth date, copied to the HR Adviser with a copy of the birth certificate as evidence of the date of birth. In this instance, maternity leave will commence th e day after the baby was born. 6 4.5. It is presumed that the full 52 weeks of leave will be taken unless notification is given of an earlier return. Please see Section 15 “Returning to work after maternity leave ” for more details about arrangements for the end of the maternity leave period. 5. Notification of return to work 5.1. By law, all employees have the right to return to work after a period of maternity leave. The following procedures should be followed to ensure protection of both legislative and contractual rights. 5.2. If an individual intends to return at the end of the full 52 weeks of maternity leave and has not notified their manager that they wish to come back at any other time, there is no need to provide any further notice. However, if the individual intends to return before the end of the 52 weeks of maternity leave or earlier or later than planned, then eight weeks' written notice must be provided. 6. Transfer of Maternity Leave – Shared Parental Leave 6.1. If an employee proposes to return to work early without using the full 52 -week entitlement to maternity leave, they may be eligible to apply for Shared Parental Leave with their partner. For more information on this, please see the Shared Parental Leave Policy and Procedure. 7. Contract of Employment 7.1. During the period of maternity leave, the employee's contract of employment continues in force, and they are entitled to receive all their contractual b enefits, except for salary. In particular, their contractual holiday entitlement will continue to accrue. 7.2. Pension contributions will continue to be made during any period when the employee is receiving maternity leave but not during any period of unpaid maternity leave. Employee contributions will be based on actual pay, while the School’s contributions will be based on the salary that the employee would have received had they not been taking maternity leave. Should the employee wish, they can make additi onal contributions for their period of unpaid leave upon returning and if they decide to do this, the School will also make contributions in accordance with the pension scheme rules. Subsequent awards of backdated salary, which take effect during the calcu lation period used to work out maternity pay, will lead to a recalculation of the amount payable. 7.3. Return to the job in which they were employed under the original contract of employment and on the same terms and conditions is automatic following the 26 w eeks of ordinary maternity leave. However, if more than 26 weeks have been taken and it is not reasonably practicable for a return to the same job then suitable alternative work with the same status 7 and on terms and conditions which are no less favourable than the original job may be offered. 8. Contact during Maternity Leave 8.1. Before an employee's maternity leave begins, the line manager and the employee should discuss arrangements for keeping in touch during the leave. The School reserves the right in any event to maintain reasonable contact with the employee from time to time during their maternity leave. This m ay be to discuss the employee's plans to return to work e.g., to consider how the employee’s maternity leave holiday accrual could be taken, to ensure the individual is aware of any possible promotion opportunities, to discuss any special arrangements to b e made or training to be given to ease their return to work or simply to update them on developments at work during their absence. 9. 'Keeping in Touch' (KIT) days 9.1. Whilst on maternity leave, individuals may either request, or be requested, to undertake up to ten days' paid work under their contract of employment. 'Keeping in Touch' days may be taken at any stage during the maternity leave period, except during the first two weeks after the b aby is born. 9.2. The type of work that an individual undertakes on a KIT day is a matter for agreement between the individual and their manager. Subject to mutual agreement, keeping in touch days may be used for any activity that would ordinarily be classed as work under an individual's contract, to undertake an important work -related training activity or to enable an individual to attend an important team meeting or conference. 9.3. Work during the maternity leave period may take place only by agreement between both an individual and their manager. A manager may not insist that an individual works during the maternity leave period if they do not wish to do so, nor does an individual have the right to a KIT day if their manager does not agree to it. 9.4. If a manage r requests that an employee works a KIT day, the individual is entitled to turn the opportunity down without suffering any consequences as a result. It is unlawful for an individual to suffer detriment for not agreeing to work KIT days, or for requesting t o work KIT days. 9.5. Where a disagreement arises in respect of KIT days either about the principle of taking such days or the schedule of how the days are to be taken, the manager and the employee should try to resolve the disagreement as informally and quick ly as possible. 9.6. Throughout the process, managers should seek advice from their HR Adviser concerning any related queries that they may have. 8 9.7. KIT days are paid by the hour at the individual's standard hourly rate. On a KIT day, an individual should wor k no more than their normal working hours set out in their appointment letter or agreed with their line manager. Any work carried out under an individual's contract on any day will count as a whole KIT day. For example, if an individual attends work only for a one -hour training session, they will have used one of their keeping in touch days. Undertaking work on a KIT day does not affect an individual's maternity pay entitlement. 9.8. To be paid for KIT days wo rked, the KIT day form should be completed by both the employee and line manager and returned to their HR Adviser. This should be received by the payroll deadline of the month in which the KIT day was worked or, if this is not possible, the following month. Payment will be made at the end of the month in which the form was received. 10. Sickness absence during pregnancy 10.1. Sickness absence during pregnancy prior to the start of the maternity leave period should be treated in the same way as normal sickness abse nce. However, pregnancy -related sickness within the four weeks immediately preceding the EWC triggers the start of the maternity leave, which will start on the day after the first complete day of absence from work. 11. Stillbirth and miscarriages 11.1. LSE will support employees throughout the practical implementation of this policy, including in the sad event of a miscarriage or stillbirth. For the purposes of this policy, a miscarriage is when a baby is born dead before the 24th week of pregnancy; a st illbirth is when the baby is born dead after the beginning of the 24th week of pregnancy. In such cases, individuals may wish to seek support from the Staff Counselling Service or the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP). 11.2. In the event of a stillbirth, the employee can still apply for and take maternity leave (and pay) under this policy. 11.3. In the event of a miscarriage, the employee is not entitled to take maternity leave. The employee is encouraged to discuss options with t heir line manager and/or HR, where relevant, to help them manage the situation. This may include taking appropriate time for their wellbeing, e.g., through a period of sickness absence and/or compassionate leave. 12. Use of accrued holiday entitlement 12.1. An emp loyee’s holiday entitlement (including a nnual leave, closure days and bank holidays) will be accrued during the whole leave period. Where on return to work either, 9 the employee is unable or, it is not operationally possible for them to take all their accrued holiday, the untaken leave can be carried over into the following year. 12.2. Employees should discuss how they wish to take the holiday entitlement that they will accrue whilst on maternity leave with their line manager, ideally before the employee starts the aforementioned leave. As with any annual leave request, this must be agreed by the line manager. The possible options to di scuss with the line manager include taking a block of accrued leave before returning to work or using accrued leave to allow a phased return to work by working shorter working weeks for a fixed period. 12.3. In the event of an individual not returning to work following the period of maternity leave, due to resignation, payment in lieu of holiday calculated up to the last working day and not taken before the start of the maternity leave will be given. 13. Non-renewal of fixed term contracts 13.1. Non-renewal of fixed -term contracts due to pregnancy is discriminatory. Fixed term contracts should be renewed if the work or funding is continuing. Where work or funding is not continuing, procedural advice should be sought from their HR Partner. 14. Redundancy 14.1. A pregnant emplo yee or one on maternity leave can be made redundant where there is a genuine redundancy situation at that time that is not connected to the pregnancy or maternity leave. As with all redundancies, the correct procedure must be followed and the normal rules relating to redundancies applied, including consultation with the employee. 14.2. Employees on maternity leave have special protection in a redundancy situation. In particu lar, they will be given priority ahead of other colleagues in being offered suitable alternative vacancies. 14.3. Managers should, therefore, ensure that HR is made aware of employees who are at risk of redundancy whilst pregnant or on maternity leave so that relevant advice can be provided. 15. Returning to work after maternity leave 15.1. Following the end of maternity leave, the employ ee is expected to return on t he next working day, unless an additional period of annual leave has been agreed or they notify the School otherwise. 10 15.2. If the employee is unable to attend work at the end of maternity leave due to sickness, the School’s normal arrangements, including notification procedures, for sickness absence will apply. 15.3. It should be noted that if an employee returns to work before the end of their 26 weeks of Ordinary Maternity Leave and subsequently falls ill, they are not eligibl e to receive Statutory Sick Pay (SSP). In this case, they would be able to resume their SMP or MA payments. 15.4. Failu re to return on the due date after the maternity leave expires will be regarded as unauthorised absence and may be treated as a disciplinary matter. 15.5. If, after the maternity leave begins, a decision is made not to return to work, the normal contractual period of notice must be given, in writing. 15.6. LSE has a range of support to enable disabled staff to successfully return to work following a period of maternity leave, including reasonable adjustments and other measures set out in the Disability Policy. In addition to pre -existing disabilities, conditions relating to maternity (especial ly antenatal and post-natal depression) can in some cases amount to a disability. In all situations, staff and managers are encouraged to seek further advice and support as appropriate, which may include their HR Partner, Staff Counselling or the EAP. 16. Heal th and safety 16.1. Pregnancy causes physical and psychological changes in an expectant mother, which may make it difficult to carry out work in the way it was done before they became pregnant. When informed that a member of staff is pregnant, managers should review the risk assessments for the work carried out and any concerns raised by the expectant mother. 16.2. The assessments should be reviewed periodically over the course of the pregnancy, and when the employee returns to work after maternity leave. Managers must also review the suitability of work or working conditions in light of any medical advice or certificates issued. In some cases, the work or shift pattern may need to be modified to enable the expectant mother to continue working. In exceptional circum stances, where it is not possible to avoid a risk and suitable alternative work is not available, suspension on full pay on health and safety grounds must take place. Managers should consult their HR Partners for advice on suspension on full pay. 16.3. The Health and Safety team have developed tips for some common difficulties pregnant employee s could experience, and what can be done about them, and can advise managers as well as new and expectant mothers if required. 11 17. Rest and breastfeeding facilities 17.1. Pregnant employees may, at times, suffer from fatigue and require rest. Managers should also be aware that new mothers may need to take short breaks throughout the day to express breast milk and should treat requests to do so sympathetically. The School provides a private room in Pethick -Lawrence House (PEL) for pregnant and breastfeeding employees. This can be accessed via the Reception in Pankhurst House. Common rooms and social spaces around the School may also be used for rest breaks. 18. Advice 18.1. An employee considering/taking maternity leave is encouraged to contact their HR Adviser to arrange an informal discussion as early as possible regarding their potential entitlement to maternity leave. 18.2. The HR Adviser will, upon receiving a notification of entitlement to take maternity leave, seek to arrange an informal discussion with the employee to talk about their intentions and how they currently expect to use their maternity leave entitlement. Also, it may be useful to discuss requests for holiday accrued during paid service and/or flexible working. 12 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years January 2026 September 202 5 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 2 Mar 2015 2 November 2022 JNICC – February 2023 Contacts Position Name Email Notes Senior HR Policy Adviser Kieran Darling k.darling@lse.ac.uk HR Policy Adviser Elisabetta Viotto e.viotto@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

Sustainability.................................................................................................................................................. 11 This policy is subject to review by SMC and potential change in all aspects in a year’s time or earlier if necessary, which means that all provisions are granted on a discretionary basis and do not establish an entitlement to staff. 1. Introduction 1.1. The School supports a blended approach to working, where possible, which gives employees and managers more o ptions over where and when work is undertaken. When done well, BLENDED WORKING POLICY blended working can enhance both service delivery and the employee experience of work. In addition, the development of a blended working culture mutually supports a more progressive approach to work which focuses on outputs. These will vary according to the nature of the role and, in addition to specific deliverables, will include a strong emphasis on collaboration, teamwork and citizenship. 1.2. The nature of academia means that the School’s acade mic staff and researchers have significant flexibility in how they work. In professional services divisions, there are many different types of job roles, including those that are office -based (e.g. administrative staff), non - office -based roles (e.g. cateri ng staff) and teaching roles (Eden Centre, Language Centre). Many staff in professional services roles can benefit from a more blended approach in terms of where and when they work. The School operates a standard 9.30am to 5.30pm and 35 hour working week f or most full -time professional services roles (exceptions apply to certain staff groups that need to be onsite at different times in the working day or at weekends, such as general assistants and security staff). 1.3. To enable the introduction and continued development of an effective culture of blended working, the School will assess the work environment for staff on an ongoing basis, including a focus on the design of workspaces, as well as ensure that the right technologies are in place to enable staff to work in a more blended manner. 1.4. In applying this policy to the School’s working practices, it is important to clarify the distinction between ‘blended’ and ‘flexible’ working. 1.4.1. ‘Blended’ working refers to the School’s generic approach to enabling a working culture which is more responsive to the specific activities of a particular role and work -life balance of staff as well as taking advantage of more efficient technologies and workspace design. In practice, this will enable many staff to combine working on campus with working remotely for a proportion of their working hours. The specific arrangements will be driven by the requirements of the role and may, therefore, change from week -to-week or at different times of th e year, for example. As such, whilst blended working supports work - life balance, staff will not have a regular pattern of ‘working from home’ days and, therefore, need to ensure that domestic arrangements, e.g., childcare, are in place that enable them to attend campus on any given day as required. 1.4.2. ‘Flexible’ working is an individual working arrangement that is agreed outside of, or in addition to, the Blended Working Policy. It refers to non -standard (‘flexible’) working arrangements that are pre -arrang ed and specifically agreed between individual employees and their managers; these include compressed hours, off -set start/finish times, schedule flexibility, part -time working, term -time only working, and/or job sharing. Where an employee wishes to request a move to a flexible arrangement on an ongoing basis, they should submit a request to their manager under the School’s Flexible Working Poli cy. In line with the policy, flexible working requests will be considered in accordance with the needs of the team and wider area, to ensure that service delivery standards can be maintained. Once a flexible working arrangement is agreed, an individual wi ll not be expected to attend work/campus on non -working days or ‘working from home’ days. 1.5 This policy should be read in conjunction with the Homeworking Policy which provides further, more detailed information about the support and expectations in rel ation to working from home.  2. Policy aims 2.1 This policy aims to: • Set out the School’s position regarding blended working • Set out the resources that the School will make available to support an effective blended working environment • Set out what is expected of employees and managers to ensure a fair, equitable and safe blended working culture which optimises our efficiency • Provide guidance to managers about manag ing staff in a blended working environment • Clarify the difference between ‘blended’ and ‘flexible’ working, as well as how they overlap. 2.2 The School will commit to achieving these aims, with the overall objective of a more strategically flexible and co llaborative working environment which enables a greater sharing of skills, a better work -life balance for staff and improved spaces for collaborative and independent working. 2.3. The approach set out in this policy is designed to promote inclusivity for all staff and, in particular, improve accessibility for staff with disabilities. Changes that are made to the working environment will proactively address accessibility requirements and reasonable adjustments will be made on a case -by-case basis based on staff’s individual needs both on campus and when working remotely. 3. Policy scope 3.1 The blended working principles set out in this policy apply to professional services staff. Staff based in divisions are likely to be those who are mainly impacted, although professional services staff in academic departments, research centres and institut es may equally benefit from blended working. It is acknowledged that some aspects of blended working may be less suited to some roles than others, e.g. remote working may not apply to those that deliver a face -to-face and frontline service. At the same tim e, a blended approach may also be possible in some traditionally present services provided that appropriate support is in place. 3.2 Managers will be responsible for deciding on the suitability of blended working in connection with specific roles, the re sponsibilities of the particular area, potential impacts on staff and student experience interacting with the area and following discussions with staff where appropriate. 4. Policy principles 4.1 It is acknowledged that there is no ‘one size fits all’ appr oach to implementing blended working. Different areas of the School have different requirements, and a blended approach to working can encompass a wide variety of different practices, depending on the needs of individuals and teams as well as on the requir ements of their roles and the work of their area. When considering how the School’s approach to blended working applies to a particular work situation, the following principles should be kept in mind: • The School recognises that an effective culture of blended working can bring significant benefits to both employees and the School, the most notable of which are set out in the benefits of blended working section below. • At the same time, blended working should not be understood as an automatic ‘right’ for each individual. Arrangements made at a local level (whether made as part of a flexible working pattern or agreed on a more ad -hoc basis) should be reviewed regularly to ensure that they continue to suit both the employee and the operational requirements. Similarly, no member of staff is required to undertake blended working if they prefer not to and/or do not have the required remote working environment to do so. • The School will provide specific equipment (as se t out below) to enable staff to undertake their roles effectively and will mak e reasonable adjustments for staff with disabilities. In agreeing to work remotely, staff should ensure that they have the appropriate remote working set -up to enable them to wor k effectively, e.g. efficient WiFi connection, private/quiet space. • It is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the costs of working remotely under blended working will be offset by savings elsewhere, e.g. in the cost and time of commuting to and f rom campus. The School is therefore not responsible for any associated costs that employees accrue when working remotely, e.g. heating costs, WiFi. Employees should discuss with their line manager if they anticipate or experience significant hardship or co st which is related to working remotely, keeping in mind that staff can request to work on campus full -time. • To create and sustain an effective blended working culture, performance will be assessed by output. Objectives and development needs should be regularly discussed and agreed in line with the existing CDR arrangements, including objective setting through the CDR process. Such outputs should focus on all areas of an employee’s role, including those contained in the Effective Behaviours Framework, e.g. collegiality. • A blended working culture is dependent on effective communication between staff. Employees should ensure that they remain contactable and accessible during working hours when working remotely in line with agreed expectations with their manager and colleagues and by using the 'availability' status tools in accordance with the Etiquette Guidance for Email and Online Collaboration Tools. The type and regularity of contact may vary depending on the nature of the role and the department, e.g. more immediate contact may be required for roles that involve fast-paced discussions and decision -making or a high level of customer service. To maintain transparency, open and frequent forums and channels of communication, including both formal and info rmal channels, should be used. • Blended working should enhance, not hinder, collaboration. Team delivery will continue to be an integral part of the School’s success and teams will work together, and support each other, to deliver agreed outcomes. Technol ogy will be used to promote connectivity and sense of belonging. • The campus will continue to be the primary place of work, but work may be carried out remotely or in different locations on campus. Location will be driven by the needs of the activity being carried out and many employees will be able to choose their times and ways of working according to the needs of their role and in line with the Core Business in Core Hours Policy. While good practice is to agree working arrangements in advance, there may be exceptional circumstances where managers may require staff to attend campus at short notice. Staff should be available to attend campus when necessary and managers should be aware that there might be some circumstances in which this is more difficul t and exercise flexibility accordingly. Members of staff will take ownership for the delivery of their objectives – whether specific deliverables or community activities – both at a team and individual level. • Whilst blended working may not apply to certa in roles and activities, due to the need for regular physical attendance on campus, all staff, regardless of role, will be treated fairly and engaged in a positive team culture and campus experience. • Blended working must be carried out safely and e mployee s will be enabled to take a more active role in their own health, safety and wellbeing. 5. The benefits of blended working 5.1 The benefits of a blended working culture at our School include: • Developing an innovative and forward -thinking, collaborative, work environment, including the use of more advanced technologies as well as the creation and development of work spaces across the School that enhance cross -department al and collaborative working (e.g. work hubs). • Maximising the efficiency of the School’s desk space (through hot -desking, remote working and similar initiatives) to reduce office accommodation and associated costs. In addition to shared desk space, the School will provide workspaces appropriate to other types of working, such as quiet spaces, phone booths and ‘coffee bar’ type spaces. • There are also potential environmental benefits as carbon emissions from more remote working are balanced by reductions in emissions from travel and from using our campus space more efficiently, contributing to the delivery of our carbon reduction targets. • More motivated staff who feel trusted to manage their own workloads and have greater control over where they work. This can in turn contribute to an environment of mutual trust and support between managers and employees. • In part as a result of the expected boost to staff motivation, a corresponding improvement in staff retention as well as a positive impact on wellbeing. • Being seen as a more attractive employer and widening the School’s appeal to differ ent types of employee who may not have considered the School in the past, allowing for greater diversity. • Improving accessibility for staff with disabilities by reducing the requirement to travel into central London. 6. Blended working in practice 6.1 Managers and employees should discuss how blended working can apply to their service area and individual roles in accordance with the Blended Working Framework for Service Areas. Managers and employees should discuss options and come to an agreement based on: i) business need and ii) personal preference of staff 1. Ultimately, it will be a management decision regarding the roles to which blended working will apply and in understanding business needs, it will be important to take into account EDI considerati ons as well the immediate work needs. Blended working options will necessarily be more limited for those that require a physical presence in a particular location, e.g. roles offering a face -to-face and frontline service or requiring particular campus -base d technical software. Similarly, there may be other roles which require on - campus presence at specific times of the year which can be carried out remotely at other times. 6.2 The feasibility of a particular blended working arrangement is also dependent on ap propriate standards being in place including health and safety, information security and agreed expectations concerning communication and performance. 6.3 In setting up blended working arrangements, managers and employees should be particularly mindful of equality considerations and ensuring that they do not unintentionally cause a detriment to certain employees. 6.4 The Blended Framework for Service Areas set s out further guidance on what blended working looks like in practice. In particular, it includes arrangements for maintaining collaboration and sense of community, such as regularity of onsite presence, team working arrangements and the use of technology to retain connectivity. This is attached as Appendix A. 6.5 The School will also work to share examples of best practice so that staff can learn from positive experiences of blended working. 7. Developing a blended working environment 7.1 The School will ensu re that sufficient resources are available to support a blended working culture. This includes the following: • Unallocated desks: a practice of ‘desk -sharing’ will apply where employees do not have their own personal desk but are given access to a desk whe n needed, from which they can set up their laptop and phone systems. Divisions will have their own ‘neighbourhoods’ and staff will be able to book desks in advance of coming onto campus through a booking system. • Allocated desks: a number of roles require an employee to have a particular desk assigned to them, and these employees should have access to an allocated desk. Reasonable adjustments will be made for employees with disabilities and considered, whereve r possible, for employees with specific health and safety needs ; this may include being allocated a preferred desk in a hot - desking environment. • Collaborative spaces: desks will be in open plan spaces to promote collaboration and where possible, the partitioning of desks and offices wil l be kept to a minimum. Staff are also 1 Please note that no member of staff will be required to work from home/remotely if they choose not to. encouraged to use offices as meeting rooms to nurture a more collaborative working environment. • Work hubs: a percentage of the total office space across the School’s estate can be used for shared “work hubs” – places on campus with IT connectivity where staff can work. These spaces will be open for anyone to book or use and will give opportunities for staff to interact with colleagues from other areas of the School. T he design of some hubs will also support meetings. • Meeting rooms: bookable meeting rooms are available across the School campus to complement the other shared workspaces and meet the operational needs of areas of the School. These should additionally be used for confidential discussions that would not be appropriate in an open plan collaborative space. • Storage spaces: sufficient storage space will be provided to staff to ensure that they have the ability to store materials (both electronic and physical) which they require in order to carry out their role and responsibilities. This will include confidential storage where applicable. In addition, staff will have sufficient storage in which to store away necessary personal items during the working day where they do not have access to a specific desk. • Cafés2: the School has several caf és and other spaces on campus that are open to both staff and students. These may be used as informal meeting places by staff where mutually agreed and where a discussio n will not include confidential or School -sensitive information. • Home/Remote working: staff will be able to work from home for a proportion of the week in accordance with their work -related activity. For a regular home/remote working arrangement, where an individual needs to agree a specific working pattern, this should be agreed under the Flexible Working Policy. • Mobile working: in additi on to home/remote working, a blended working culture encourages staff to spend time on campus but not at a desk. The School will enable these types of working by providing staff with access to touch down centres or community hubs around the campus, i.e., d edicated areas where staff can access a phone and either plug in a laptop or connect it wirelessly to access all software and files as though they were in the office. Staff can also check their work email from anywhere using a mobile phone or other hand -held device; staff will be able to connect to back -office systems via these devices to access files and other information. 8. Technology support for blended working 8.1 Appropriate technology will be provided to support staff in undertaking blended working. This will include the following standard set -up for shared desks: screen (including docking station), mouse, keyboard and second screen. A laptop and headset will also be provided for working both on campus and remotely. 8.2 In addition, the following technologies are available to enable staff who are working remotely to interact with their colleagues: • Video conferencing : in addition to telephone calls and emails, Sch ool employees have access to Microsoft Teams, which allows up to 250 employees to meet through video conferencing. 2 Expenses incurred from meeting in a café are not reimbursable by the School. Video conferencing is particularly useful for enabling individual staff who work remotely to participate in meetings and to collaborate natio nally and internationally without the need to travel, reducing our carbon emissions. • Web conferencing: this is a more recent technology which allows all participants to view the same web -based presentation and discuss it simultaneously via instant message s. • Presence: the ability to see when people are busy, in a meeting, or at their desks using the coloured ‘presence’ dot on their profiles. • Instant chat: Microsoft Teams also allows for t wo or more users to exchange messages. Messages appear on the user’s computer screen and they allow for the sharing of documents at the same time. Users should be aware that messages sent through the chat function are disclosable in the event of a data subject access request in the same way as other forms of written communication. • Data encryption and cyber security : all staff are responsible for taking appropriate precautions when processing, sharing or accessing data remotely. Comprehensive guidance and support can be found on DTS’s Cyber Security webpages, including minimum standards for devices, a user awareness course, how best to store and handle data, protect electronic devices, and identify malicious communications (e.g. phishing attempts). All staff (and students) in LSE are required to use Multi -factor Authentication for access to School systems. If they have not already done so, any member of staff in possession of an LSE laptop or other electronic device should complete and submit an audit form to DTS to ensure that the device is properly encrypted, requires a complex password (or biometrics) for access, and is GDPR -compliant. 8.3 All staff should ensure that they have appropriate broadband width to be able to support the above technology and the ir home /remote working activities ; this will not be suppo rted by LSE. 8.4 Disabled staff should discuss with their manager any technological support that is required as a reasonable adjustment to enable them to work safely and effectively both on campus and remotely. Where appropriate, specialist advice may be sought from Occupational Health. Relevant software and equipment will be provided for remote working as a reasonable adjustment or where there is a health and safety need that cannot reasonably be met through alternative measures. 9. Managing in a blended work environment 9.1 Most of the key management skills are the same in a blended working culture as in a more static work environment, and managers should continue to manage workloads, supervise, motivate and manage performance in the usual way. At th e same time, it is important that there is a common understanding of what is expected in terms of employee -manager interactions when an employee is working in a blended way. A wide range of different working arrangements are possible, provided that all par ties are in mutual agreement about how those arrangements will work in practice. 9.2 In line with the principles of this policy, managers should assess the performance of employees who are able to work in a blended way by output. Depending on the nature of t he role, employees can be free to plan their own time when working in a blended way, provided that they meet agreed performance objectives, are still contactable in line with the expectations agreed with their manager and continue to contribute to the LSE community as a whole. 9.3 In particular, the following points apply to managing in a blended work environment. Many of these apply regardless of where or when work is taking place, although at times managers may need to adjust how they interact with employees, for example if the manager is communicating with an employee less often than if they were physically in the office. • Manager and employee should agree clear performance objectives within defined time periods. Where possible, it may help to consider the employee’s workload in terms of defined pieces of work, e.g. writing a report, collaborating on a project group. • Managers should provide regular feedback on performance, including positive reinforcement of achievements. • Expectations should be agreed abo ut how and when an employee can be contacted if they are working in a blended way. A pattern of regular communications should be established which includes one to ones and team meetings, as well as inclusion in any relevant correspondence. • Employees worki ng in a blended way should participate in performance reviews (including the annual CDR process) as normal to ensure that their development needs are discussed. Similarly, they should have access to learning and development opportunities, and consideration for promotion and other career progression, in the same way as if they were working in the office. • Managers should review any local blended working arrangements on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to function effectively. This includes providing regular feedback to (and receiving feedback from) employees who are working in a blended way. Any resourcing issues (e.g. ICT equipment for staff working remotely or the provision of meeting rooms and hubs for on -campus collaboration) should be raised promptly with the relevant point of contact. 9.4 Managers should also be aware that blended working may result in staff feeling isolated or lonely. Operating blended working within the framework will help to minimise this by ensuring that all staff are involved in meetings (e.g. whether onsite or through videoconferencing) and making sure that communications include some personal o r social content as well as strictly work -related matters. Managers should ensure that they maintain regular contact with staff, for example by arranging ‘virtual coffee breaks’ where the manager and employee agree to be available to speak over the phone a t a pre -arranged time. It is also important that employees agree with their line managers whether they should attend regular team meetings in person as well as participate in any performance reviews so that their ongoing development needs are discussed. So cial events should be arranged that enable all staff to attend in person where possible. 10. Health and Safety 10.1 Everyone has responsibility for ensuring health and safety at work. Staff should make sure that they adjust their workstation and chair to sui t their needs, whether they are working from home, remotely, hot -desking or at a preferred desk. Any requirements or concerns about their workspace should be raised with their manager as well as other teams as appropriate (such as through an online health and safety assessment or with DTS). 10.2 Employees who wish to regularly work remotely/from home as a result of blended working should ensure that they complete the relevant online health and safety assessment based on their remote working environment i n order to ensure that this constitutes an appropriate workspace. Employees should adopt the same practices and make relevant adjustments as set out in the assessment, (e.g. workspace set -up, posture, ability to move around) when working remotely to ensure that they have a suitable and comfortable place in which to work. The assessment provides advice on all elements of a safe working environment, signposts to support and offers additional health and safety training. 10.3 Where health and safety concerns are raised – either by employees or through the health and safety assessment – staff will be offered advice on steps that can be taken to improve their remote working arrangements. If this is not possible for an employee, they will be able to work full -time on campus and will be provided with a suitable workspace to do so. 10. 4 Disabled staff should discuss with their manager any reasonable adjustments that are required in order to work safely and effectively both on campus and remotely. Where appropriate, specialist advice may be sought from Occupational Health. Relevant furniture will be provided for remote working as a reasonable adjustment or where there is a health and safety need that cannot reasonably be met through alternative measures. 11. Wellbeing 11.1 Managers should regularly check in with staff on their wellbeing when they are working in a blended way, in particular to ensure that they are not working excessive hours. In particular, the improved communications made possible by improve ments in IT provision should not result in staff feeling obliged to regularly respond to emails outside normal working hours or on weekends (some exceptions may apply to certain senior management positions). 11.2 Staff and managers should be aware of th e increased temptation to work longer hours and the difficulties in being able to switch off when working remotely. Staff should be encouraged to retain a structure to the working day/week and ensure that they ‘leave’ work in the same way as they would if they were in the office. This is in addition to support staff in taking regular breaks – both throughout the day and by taking annual leave. 11.3 Staff and managers should refer to the Etiquette Policy for Email and other Online Communication Tools for further information about the use of notification settings to ensure that individual’s non - working time is protected and respected. Information on the wellbeing resources available to staff can also be found on the Staff Wellbeing webpages. 11.4 Concern s regarding wellbeing should be raised with the relevant manager or HR Partner so that advice can be given on the most appropriate way to address this and steps taken to remove any specific work -related factors where relevant. 12. Equality Considerations 12.1 Managers should be mindful of equality considerations when considering how blended approaches to working could function in their teams. In addition, the School will periodically gather feedback from staff (including surveys) about the ir experience of blended working, so that any potential issues in terms of staff access to blended working can be identified and addressed.  13. Dignity at Work 13.1 The arrangement of ‘desk -sharing’ will mean that staff are regularly working alongside different colleagues – both within and outside of their own team/division. It will, therefore, be essential that, in accordance with the Dignity at Work Statement, staff take care to treat colleagues with dignity and respect at all times. 13.2 In particular, staff should ensure that they behave in a respectful way that embraces inclusivity and creates a welcoming and positive environment for all staff regardless of any protected characteristics. 13.3 The School’s Dignity at Work Statement and Discrim ination, Bullying and Harassment Policy provide definitions and examples of inappropriate behaviour. Staff should ensure that they are informed about what is, and is not, appropriate so that they do not risk inadvertently creating an unpleasant environment for those around them. 13.4 Managers should be aware that staff, particularly those with protected characteristics, might choose to work remotely more frequently to avoid potentially uncomfortable situations. This could, in turn, lead to them becoming isolat ed from their team/colleagues. Where a manager is concerned that this might be the case, this should be raised with individuals in a supportive way to facilitate a resolution, if appropriate. 14. Sustainability 14.1. Departments, divisions and staff will take active steps to: • Use campus buildings space as efficiently as possible, for instance by desk sharing, contributing to the delivery of our carbon reduction targets. • Minimise business travel, and in particular a ir travel, as a simple way to reduce our carbon emissions. • Reduce printing by embracing the transition from paper to Digital Smart, reducing our use of resources. • Switch to virtual phones, centralised printing and only buy e -devices for demonstrated need s, to help reduce our environmental impacts. • Recycle all unwanted LSE devices by arranging collection with: estates.porters@lse.ac.uk. For small items (e.g. USB sticks/CDs/cables) by using the recycling point at the Student Centre reception (Saw Swee Hock building).

In all cases the total package value is limited to £25,000. The School is developing a range of services, in ass ociation with external providers, to support new faculty during their and their family's relocation to ensure the process goes as smoothly as possible. These services are set out below. Some of these services may have an associated cost in which case a cha rge will be made against your relocation package. 4. Eligible expenditure a) Tax free claims (up to £8,000) as per the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC – UK Tax Authorities) relocation scheme HMRC guidance on relocation expenses and benefits can be found on the HMRC Website. (i) Temporary accommodation - including staff accommodation booked through the School’s Accommodation o ffice. HMRC regulations state ‘temporary living accommodation’ is allowable only where the employee intends to move to permanent accommodation to complete the relocation. Contributions towards the cost of such accommodation will not be eligible for exempti on from tax where a person is posted to a new location and moves into accommodation which they occupy for a considerable period as their main residence. If you elect to stay in School owned accommodation and wish to claim the cost of this as part of your A llowance, please ask the Residences Booking office to invoice the LSE Coordinator directly.

(vi) The professional fees incurred on the initial letting of a property on an assured shorthold tenancy, such as letting agency fees, where you are a named tenant and the property will be used as your main residence within the Reasonable Travelling Distance. Security deposits 3 and other refundable deposits related to rental accommodation may not be claimed under this Policy. (vii) The services of a relocation company for the removal and related insurance of household effects. You will need to obtain 3 quotes for removal and supply these to the Relocation Coordinator. The removal company that supplies the lowest quotation will normally be chosen, unless you have expressed strong reasons to the Coordinator to choose another supplier.

Relocation expenses for the above in excess of £8,000 will incur income tax and National Insurance Contributions. b) No n-qualifying expenses relating to relocation You may claim reimbursement for the below expenses however they are considered non -qualifying relocation expenses according to HMRC and will incur income tax and National Insurance Contributions regardless of the £8,000 tax free threshold: (i) Office Moves – the HMRC relocation scheme applies to personal effects only and does not cover the removal of office items. Therefore, any claims relating to office moves will incur income tax and NICs. (ii) Orientation – initial consultation followed by an accompanied area orientation tour with a specialist consultant, including discussion of residential suitability, schooling, housing, transportation, healthcare and other amenities. (iii) School search – explanation of the U K education system and consultation of child’s/children’s needs, provision of information on best performing schools, published league tables, written report on availability and appropriate schools.

(v) Immigration Health Surcharge – as part of visa applications 5. Conditions Under the Relocation Scheme applications can only be made for one relocation allowance per household. Timescale for incurring relocation expenses The HMRC guidelines that govern the Relocation Scheme set an allowable timescale within which relocation expenses need to be incurred. In order to qualify, expenses must be incurred before the end of the tax year following the one in which the new appointment is taken up (current tax year +1). As such, applications for relocation package must be made to the Relocation Coordinator within 12 4 months of the date of commencement of the appointment. However, if it is not possible to move within the defined timescale, applicants are required in the first instance to contact the Relocation Coordinator explaini ng the reasons for the delay. This will then enable the School to seek permission for an extension from HMRC. Only when HMRC grants an extension will the applicants be eligible for the Relocation Scheme. Timescale for seeking reimbursement Once expenses are incurred applications for reimbursement must be made to the Relocation Coordinator within 6 months, as per LSE Financial Regulations. Claims can be submitted as each expense is incurred, or all together, and must include detailed receipts for each clai med item. No payments will be made beyond the limit of your allowance. The School reserves the right to reclaim any accidental overpayments made to you under this policy from your net salary. Income tax Applicants should be aware that under UK tax law, su ms paid in connection with relocation are treated by HMRC (the UK tax authorities) as a benefit in kind and may be treated as earnings and subject to taxation. The School will pay the relocation expenses covered by this scheme without deduction of tax but will be obliged to submit returns (P11D) to HMRC at the end of each tax year of any expense paid regardless of tax free threshold. The Relocation Coordinator can advise on the treatment of such items and potential implications for the claimant. Repayment Should a member of staff in receipt of a relocation package voluntarily leave LSE within 3 years of appointment, a proportion of the package will be repayable based on each full year worked (i.e. 100% repayable under one year, 66.67% repayable after one ye ar, 33.33% repayable after two years). Any amounts repayable will be deducted directly in equal installments from your net salary during your notice period. Any outstanding sums that are not recovered by the School from your net salary by the end of your e mployment with the School will remain your liability and will be invoiced to you with 15 day payment terms. After this period, interest will accrue at the official HMRC interest rate on any outstanding sum. Discretion Any costs incurred by the staff membe r through the use of the School’s relocation services will be paid directly by the School charged against the staff member’s relocation package. On application to the Finance Director, an advance of 50% of the relocation expenses may be made up to six weeks before the date of taking up appointment on production of satisfactory evidence of expenditure. In exceptional circumstances some support may be available to staff who do not meet all the criteria set out in this policy. Such cases will be considere d by the Finance Director based on a case made by the department head and HR. Policy changes The School reserves the right to change this policy without notice. The latest version is available on the School’s website at LSE Human Resources and should be referred to directly. 5 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 123 00/00/00 00/00/00 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 123 00/00/00 abc abc 123 00/00/00 abc abc Links Reference Link 123 abc 123 abc Contacts Position Name Email Notes abc abc abc@lse.ac.uk abc Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 Introduction This guidance should be read in conjunction with the Policy on Trans Staff and Students. This guidance is specifically relevant to members of staff who propose to undergo, or are undergoing a process of socially aligning their gender expression with their gender identity, rather than with their birth -assigned sex. This is described as ‘transition’. Often this is supported by medical interventions, and changes to names, titles and documentation. Under the Equality Act 2010, the ‘process’ or any ‘part of the process’ of moving away from the gender expression typically associated with the sex assigned at birth, towards an expression that reflects the gender identity, is referred to as “gender reassignment”. This is a ‘protected characteristic’ under the Equality Act 2010, which provides legal safeguards against discrimination, harassment and vict imisation, from the moment that a person ‘proposes’ to transition. (See ‘Legislation’ in Policy for Transgender Staff and Students). The guidance also applies to those who reverse such a transition. Separate guidance will be put in place for trans studen ts who are in the process of transition. Background information Many, but not all, trans people decide to undergo transition. Where they seek medical interventions, Transitioning at work: guidance for staff and managers Operational 2 the GP should refer them to a gender specialist. This may be a private provider, but this is expensive, so specialised treatment is usually initiated in an NHS Gender Identity Clinic (GIC). After assessments to establish the needs of the individual, treatment may commence that may initially include, for instance: hormone therapy, hair removal t reatments, and Speech and Language Therapy. Those who wish to access hormone therapy are not required to have transitioned at work. However, in order to access some surgeries, a continuous change of gender role and expression for at least 12 months, in a ll aspect the trans person’s life, including their place of work, is a criterion. Owing to insufficient capacity in the provision of medical care for trans people, the waiting times can be several years to access a GIC and there are further delays for acce ss to surgical services. These factors cause great stress for those seeking medical help. Managing the transition process Notification of transition When a member of staff is considering transition, a meeting should be requested with their line manager, and possibly a member of HR and/or a trade union representative, depending on the personal wishes of the individual concerned. This is a confidential meeting in which an outline plan or ‘memorandum of understanding’ may be drawn up. This is a flex ible document, not a contract, but rather a demonstration that the School will act according to the person’s wishes and in their best interests. It may be changed in line with evolving circumstances. Transition in the workplace has the potential to trigge r prejudiced or discriminatory behaviours, unless prior training has taken place. The School has made is clear through its Policy and Code of Conduct, that such behaviour will not be tolerated. Nevertheless, the trans person may feel particularly anxious d uring this time, as may their immediate colleagues. Managers should reassure them that they will be supported, and that immediate action will be taken if any incidents occur. The person may turn to their designated ‘point of contact’ as well as being signp osted to outside means of support if required1. It is recommended that the issues below are considered during the initial consultation meeting: • agree a designated person to be mentor and ‘point of contact’; • the expected timing of the transition of gender role at work; • what time off may be required for medical appointments and any medical procedures; • what amendments will be required to identity cards, records and systems; • whether the employee wishes to inform colleagues themselves, or would prefer this to be done for them; • how and when this information will be communicated; • how to handle any discrimination, harassment or hostile actions. Disclosure – who, when and how It is up to the trans person to decide whom to tell, and when and how to tell them. Ther e is no absolute obligation for staff to be informed that a colleague is about to transition. Nevertheless, in order that transition moves forward smoothly, some level of prior communication is necessary for those with whom the individual has ongoing working relationships, for instance, staff working in the 1 See https://www.gires.org.uk/the -wiki for details of support groups 3 same office. This would be provided on a limited, ‘need to know’ basis, so that the requirement to use the new name and pronouns, and to share facilities, is understood by work colleagues. Some trans pe ople may wish to ensure that the wider School population is apprised of the situation, in which case, a carefully worded email may be sent simultaneously to appropriate staff and also, where relevant, to the students whom the trans person may work closely with or teach. In this situation the trans person may prefer to tell their students, face to face. Managers must be available to support their staff member through this process. A designated person in the HR Division will need to be informed so that they can make changes in documentation and records. This will usually be the relevant HR Partner. Before an individual communicates their decision to transition, it is recommended ensuring that trans awareness training be available for other staff members to attend should they should choose. If the trans person wishes to be a part of the training, and chooses to take the opportunity to tell colleagues at that time, this should be accommodated sensitively. Time Off For Medical Appointments The majority of people who transition undergo some level of medical treatment. This may necessitate taking time off work and may have an impact on the workload of colleagues. There is specific protection under the Equality Act for time off related to g ender treatments. Staff and managers should ensure that no discrimination occurs against a person taking time off for such treatments. Trans people must not be treated less favourably than those absent because of illness or other medical treatment. Time off to attend a hospital or doctor's appointment which lasts for less than half of a working day should not be counted as sick leave, but if an appointment means an absence of a half -day or more, it should be recorded as sickness absence in the normal way. The usual statutory and occupational sick pay rules will apply (see Sickness Absence Procedures ). Most surgery is not undertaken in the first couple of years following transition, but when major surgery is planned, managers should be flexible with regard to time off. Time away from work for surgery and to recover from surgery will be recorded as sickness absence, but should not normally trigger the formal Capability Health Procedure. Staff may be asked to attend an Occupational Health Assessment before their return to work after any long -term absence, to ensure that they are fully recovered before returning to full duties. Managers should discuss any adjustments that might need to be made to facilitate the return to work. Name change, records and confi dentiality Trans staff who have undertaken transition are likely to be anxious to protect their privacy with regard to their previously ascribed gender. The right to confidentiality must be respected. Current records/ letters/ documents for trans staff sh ould not refer to a previous name. Where these can’t be changed, they must be kept separate from the records of other staff, in locked storage and only accessed by named persons approved by the trans person, and with their permission, unless emergency circ umstances occur. In a small number of cases, it may be necessary for some records (e.g. with regard to pensions and insurance) to retain a reference to the sex of the employee at birth. Access to such records, and all personnel records should be restricte d only to staff who require such details to perform their specific duties. Paper documents – as above – must not be accessible to those who do not deal directly with this person’s pension or insurance situation. IT records must be password protected in 4 such a way that they are not accessible to anyone other than those directly involved. A trans individual will be able to change their name unofficially, as soon as they request this, e.g. through the “known as” field on HR’s personnel and payroll system. Whe re staff members confirm on their employee record that they are trans, they will also be able to specify their preferred gender identity. Formal change of records at the School can be undertaken upon production of a formal change of name certificate, for example, a Deed Poll or Statutory Declaration document. Trans individuals do not need a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). A newly recruited member of staff may already have a GRC and choose to volunteer this information, but it must not be requested. Those who are proposing to transition or have recently done so, cannot obtain a GRC. This requires the applicant to have lived permanently in their new gender role, full -time, for two years prior to the application and is therefore irrelevant when a person transitions. Practical arrangements The School supports the use, by trans staff, of the toilet facilities appropriate to the new gender role from the time of transition. In line with our policy document, the School will provide adequate gender neutral toilets to accommodate non- binary, non -gender and other gender diverse people. Trans people are not required to use these where male and female toilets are also provided, unless they choose to do so. They should have immediate access to the toilets that are appropriate to their gender identity a nd expression. Others who are not willing to share toilet facilities with a trans person will have the option of using gender neutral or accessible facilities. Treatment of trans members of the School community Harassment The School will not tolerate b ullying, harassment and/or victimisation on the basis of gender identity and/or transitioning at work. The School’s Anti -Bullying and Anti -Harassment Policy should be referred to if any instances occur. When other staff members or students are told about the proposed transition or become aware of it, they may have questions that are, intentionally or unintentionally, personal or intrusive. Any general awareness training should cover the issue of unaccepta ble questions, for instance, asking about surgery, which could be regarded as harassment. Some trans people are more willing to answer questions than others, so it is important that the trans individual and their manager discuss this in advance. For some staff and students this will be their first engagement with a person who has transitioned and they may fear ‘saying the wrong thing’. This can lead to isolation of the individual which is also unhelpful. Training should include educating staff about how t hey can be welcoming of a newly transitioned trans person, without being intrusive. It is not the responsibility of the trans individual to educate those around them; however, there may need to be some patience exercised with colleagues who make mistakes, such as using the wrong pronoun. Everyone does need to understand, however, that this is very painful to the trans person. If this is done with malicious intent it would amount to harassment. All members of the LSE community should also be aware that e veryone has responsibility to challenge discrimination towards trans staff (as with all discrimination). Individuals and teams 5 should be supportive of their trans colleagues and not tolerate unacceptable behaviour that is witnessed or overheard. It is not acceptable to use the term ’banter’ to excuse offensive behaviour. Recruitment related issues It should not be expected that applicants and interviewees for employment will wish to disclose transgender status - some people consider it a very private mat ter; also many have experienced prejudice and harassment as a result of disclosure. This status is not relevant and a question about this topic should never be asked at interview. If the applicant does choose to disclose, this should never be a reason for not offering employment. Where DBS checks are necessary, the School will inform all applicants that there is a confidential checking process for trans applicants which does not require them to disclose their previous identity to their employer. Trans app licants can contact the DBS applications line for further advice about completing the DBS checking form. The DBS keeps the relevant identity information secure from the employer and it is not printed on the DBS certificate. If giving a reference for someo ne moving to a new job, the referee must use the name which is used by the trans member of staff and not refer to a former name. 6 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 123 00/00/00 00/00/00 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 123 00/00/00 abc abc 123 00/00/00 abc abc Links Reference Link 123 abc 123 abc Contacts Position Name Email Notes abc abc abc@lse.ac.uk abc Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 1. Introduction 1.1. A fair and effective recruitment and selection process is essential to the ongoing success of the School. This policy sets out the broad principles that apply to the recruitment of professional services staff (PSS) across the School and should be read in conjunction with the procedure which follows. 1.2. Since 31 October 2019, the personal details of applicants for professional services vacancies have been anonymised at the shortlisting stage. 1.3. This policy and procedur e is supported by a number of supplementary sources of information, including a comprehensive Recruitment Toolkit which is av ailable on the HR Division’s webpages. Recruitment and selection training is also available for recruitment panel members. 2. Policy aims 2.1. The aim of this policy is to set out principles for the fair and effective recruitment and selection of professional services staff, and to provide a procedure for doing so. 3. Policy scope 3.1. This policy applies to the recruitment of all salaried professional services roles in the School. It is recognised that individual departments, divisions, centres and institutes (DDCIs) may also have their own local recruitment strategies for attracting an d selecting the best individuals for their relevant disciplines and professions; at the same time, those local strategies should align with the broad principles set out here. 3.2. Separate procedures apply to the recruitment of hourly paid staff and those on casual contracts; these can be found on the HR Division’s webpages. Separate procedures also apply to the recruitment of academic, research, policy and teaching roles. Recruitment and Selection Policy (Professional Services Salaried Staff) Operational 2 3.3. The expectations for recruiting managers apply to all managers who are recruiting f or professional services roles. At times, a recruiting manager may nominate another appropriate individual to undertake certain aspects of the recruitment process on their behalf. 4. Policy responsibilities 4.1. Recruiting managers are responsible for: • Recruiting to professional services roles in line with this policy and procedure as well as relevant supporting guidance and other resources • Seeking support and advice from HR as appropriate during a recruitment and selection process, and engaging construc tively with feedback • Ensuring that at least one member of a recruitment panel (usually the Chair) has undertaken the School’s recruitment and selection training • Ensuring that updates to the journeys of applicants and candidates are accurately captured in the e -Recruitment system • Ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place for new starters, including inductions • Ensuring that recruitment is in line with the School’s Financial Regulations • Ensuring that a contract is sent out in advance of the person’s start date and that they have completed a right to work check before they start any work 4.2. Recruitment panels (both shortlisting and interview) ar e responsible for: • Being aware of their responsibilities during the recruitment and selection process, and familiarising themselves with this policy and procedure 4.3. The Human Resources Division (HR) are responsible for: • Advising recruiting managers as appropriate on the application of this policy and procedure • Ensuring that this policy and associated processes are monitored and updated as required to promote equity, diversity and inclusion in the workplace 5. Policy principles 5.1. Recruitment of professiona l services roles will be fair, transparent and subject to open competition, with the consistent aim of identifying and appointing the best candidate for a role on the grounds of merit in relation to the Job Description and Person Specification. 5.2. All recruitment for professional services roles will follow the School’s anonymised applications process and will be undertaken through the School’s e -Recruitment system. 5.3. Selection decisions should be explicitly based upon evidence, although the evidence required may vary according to the type of role. Applications, interviews and references are routine sources of evidence. Evidence may also be sought through the use of personality profiles and occupational tests. 5.4. Where possible, managers involved in th e recruitment and selection of professional services roles will have undertaken the School’s recruitment and selection training. 5.5. LSE aims to ensure that staff at all grades proportionally reflect the diversity which enriches the LSE community. In support of this aim, the School has a Fair Recruitment Advisers initiative to address underrepresentation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals in senior professional services roles. 5.6. The School is committed to supporting employees during periods of change and to redeploying employees, where possible, if they are at risk of redundancy. In line with this commitment, staff who ar e eligible for redeployment will be given priority access to vacancies before they are advertised more widely to the School or externally. Recruiting managers should consult the Redeployment Policy and Procedure or contact their HR Adviser for further guid ance. 3 5.7. Relevant safeguarding procedures will be followed for all professional services recruitment, including checks via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) where appropriate for the role. 5.8. The successful appointment of any professional services role requir es the receipt of at least one satisfactory reference. All references should be requested via the e -Recruitment system and the completed references will be retained on the system. References will be confidential and should only be used for the purpose for which they were intended. Any request received for disclosure of a reference should be forwarded to the LSE Data Protection Officer. 5.9. The acquisition, retention and disposal of all information during recruitment processes under this policy will comply wit h the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and any relevant UK data protection legislation. Applicants and candidates will accordingly have the right to access any documentation or other information held about them in accordance with GDPR. 6. Disabili ty and the recruitment process 6.1. The School is part of the Disability Confident scheme, which includes the following actions to ensure that the School’s recruitment processes are as inclusive and accessible as possible: • Applicants who indicate that they have a disability will be offered an interview provided that they meet the essential criteria for a role • Reasonable adjustments will be offered and provided to any interview candidate with a disability 6.2. In line with the S chool’s anonymised applications process, information concerning an applicant’s disability status will only be disclosed to relevant individuals and at an appropriate stage of the recruitment process. 7. Confidentiality 7.1. At all stages of a recruitment process, information concerning individual candidates should only be divulged on a ‘need to know’ basis. As a result of the School’s anonymised applications process, the personal details of applicants for professional service s roles will not be visible to recruitment panels until after the shortlisting stage and once an applicant has accepted an offer to attend an interview. 7.2. Information obtained as part of a recruitment process, including submitted applications and notes ma de by recruitment panels, will be retained by the panel and disposed of in line with the School’s GDPR obligations. 8. Conflicts of interest 8.1. The School operates a fair and transparent recruitment process for professional services staff. Under the anonymised applications process, the identity of applicants will be withheld from selection panels until the applicant has accepted an invit ation to interview. All staff involved in the recruitment and selection of staff should declare any potential conflicts of interest or personal interests concerning any candidates to the Chair of the recruitment panel as soon as they become aware of them. Further guidance is available in the School’s Conflicts of Interest Policy. 8.2. Examples of conflicts of interest could be where a panel member is a close friend or family member of a candidate. Depending on the individual circumstances, the panel member may be precluded from taking any further part in the recruitment process, in which case they may be replaced by a suitable substitute. 4 9. Equity, diver sity and inclusion in recruitment 9.1. The recruitment of professional services roles should satisfy strong principles of equity, diversity and inclusion in accordance with the School’s commitments and the Equality Act 2010. 9.2. Job descriptions will contain the following equality and diversity statement: ‘LSE is committed to building a diverse, equitable and truly inclusive University. We actively encourage diversity and inclusion, while opposing all forms of unlawful and unfair discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex a nd sexual orientation.’ 9.3. All adverts for professional services roles will include the following equality and diversity statement: ‘LSE is committed to building a diverse, equitable and truly inclusive University’. All adverts should also include the Disab ility Confident logo. In addition, a recruiting manager may choose to include additional wording to the effect that applications are welcome from certain underrepresented groups. The recruiting manager is encouraged to speak with their HR Adviser if they w ould like such additional wording to be included so that the HR Adviser can ensure that the wording selected is appropriate. 9.4. The School organises recruitment and selection training for managers which includes equity, diversity and inclusion awareness. At least one member of the selection panel for a recruitment process (usually the Chair) should have attended this training prior to the start of the process. Where no panel members have attended such training, the recruiting manager should contact their H R Adviser for advice on next steps. 9.5. It is recognised that BAME staff are underrepresented at senior levels across the School. In response to this, the School has introduced the Fair Recruitment Advisers initiative, under which all PSS interviews at band 7 and above will have a Fair Recruitment Adviser on the panel. Further details are available on the Fair Recruitment Advisers webpag e. 10. Right to Work and Visa Sponsorship 10.1. All offers of employment are subject to the individual providing proof of their right to work in the UK before they undertake work of any kind (including training and induction) and by no later than 9:30am on their first day of employment. If a recruiting manager would like their new employee to start later than 9:30am on their first day of employment, the recruiting manager must send an email to HR.Admin@lse.ac.uk confirming that the employee did not undertake any work before the right to work check was undertaken. 10.2. If the successful candidate is a national of a non -UK country, they will need to obtain a visa to work in the UK. Applicants are asked to specify their visa status at the application stage so an HR Adviser can advise the recruiting department/division/centre/institute ( DDCI ) if any of the shortlisted candidates require visas and outline the support that the School can provide. The recruiting manager shou ld be aware that, in order to sponsor a candidate, they need to be able to demonstrate that they have advertised the role externally and have considered all applicants fairly against the criteria specified in the job advert for the role. 10.3. A role must meet the criteria for sponsorship before a decision can be made as to whether to sponsor. The role must: • Meet t he minimum skills level of RQF3 (equivalent to A -Level) or above and • Meet t he minimum salary threshold which is either £25,600 or the minimum salary as set for that particular occupation - whichever is higher 5 10.4. In order to sponsor the role, the vacancy must be advertised in accordance with the Home Office’s rules. To meet the rules, the following conditions must have been met: • The role must have been advertised externally for a minimum of 2 weeks and a copy of screenshots taken by HR staff and approved by the HR Operations Manager. • The advert must clearly state the salary range on offer, and any market supplements, where applicable. • The advert must include a brief description of the job duties and responsibilities of the post. • The advert must include the key criteria which will be used to shortlist for the post and these must be consistent with the wording used in the person specifica tion. 10.5. LSE is normally able to sponsor academic and research roles, however sponsorship for professional services roles is considered on a case -by-case basis. Recruiting managers wishing to sponsor a professional services role will need to make a business case to the School before making an offer to a candidate. The business case must explain why there is an exceptional need to sponsor, for example demonstrating that there is a strategic need for the role or that the role requires scarce skills that would otherwise be difficult to recruit. Recruiting managers must also identify a suitable Standard Occupational Code of Practice to match the role against, and state the reasons they ha ve chosen this code as part of the business case. The recruiting manager should contact the HR Immigration Compliance team for further advice on whether LSE can act as a sponsor for a role. 10.6. If a business case is a pproved, recruiting managers will need to provide a copy of their shortlisting grid and interview outcome summary as evidence that they have conducted the selection process fairly against the criteria. The recruiting manager may also have to provide addit ional explanation of how they have ensured that the successful candidate has met the criteria, if applicable, for example by checking that they have any qualifications that were stated as essential to the role. LSE cannot sponsor any candidate who does no t meet the essential criteria for the role. 10.7. Only HR is authorised to issue certificates of sponsorship (CoS). In addition to the CoS, the individual must apply for a visa through the UK Visas and Immigration service and will normally need to provide perso nal evidence of competence in English and ongoing maintenance. The process can take three months once the visa application is submitted, and staff cannot under any circumstances be employed until the visa is granted. 11. Safeguarding and DBS checks 11.1. All applicants to professional services roles will be asked to declare any unspent criminal convictions when applying for a position at the School. Failure to declare any unspent convictions may lead to an offer of employment being withdrawn. 11.2. In addition, the School undertakes safeguarding checks via the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) for certain roles. The DBS makes decisions about whether an individual is barred from working with children or vulnerable adults. 11.3. Where a role requires a DBS check, this will be made clear on the advert. Once the successful candidate has indicated their acceptance of the offer, the recruiting manager should contact their HR Administrator so that the DBS application process will be st arted. DBS checks are completed via an online process; HR will receive notification when a check is completed as well as when any additional information is revealed as part of the check. 11.4. Where any additional information is revealed as a result of a DBS c heck, this will normally be discussed between HR and the recruiting manager. Any information disclosed that is relevant to the nature of the role and/or is likely to lead to the withdrawal or amendment of a job offer should be discussed with the candidate before a final decision is taken. 6 11.5. In cases where an application for a check is delayed, the individual may start in the role provided that they are adequately supervised by their line manager. 11.6. Upon receipt of the DBS certificate, the employee should br ing the original to HR so that a central record can be made. 11.7. Further information can be found in the School’s policy statements concerning DBS checks and the recruitment of ex -offenders. 7 Recruitment and Selection Procedure for Professional Services Staff 1.

Further guidance and support ……………………………………………………………..… ……… 15 8 Recruitment and Selection Procedure for Professional Services Staff The following procedure should be followed sequentially for all professional services staff recruitment. 1. Preparation Stage 1.1. The recruiting manager should seek approval from the Head or Director of the DDCI as appropriate prior to advertising a post. This may involve a full evaluation of the need for the role against the DDCI’s strategic and budgetary plans. 1.2. Once the approval/ evaluation stage is complete, the recruiting manager should draft (or update as necessary) the job description, person specification and advert for the role. Templates of these documents can be found in the Recruitment Toolkit. The advertising documents should accurately reflect the expected duties of the role as well as the values to be demonstrated by the future post holder so that they are consistent with the School’s Ethics Code. Where necessary, the recruiting manager should consult with their HR Adviser. 1.3. Careful consideration should be given to the person specification, since it will be used to inform both the shortlisting and interview stages of the recruitment process. The person specification should state both the “essential” and “desirable” criteria for the role. “Essential” criteria are those without which the job could not be performed (such as communication skills), whereas “desirable” criteria are those that would enable an individual to perform the job well (such as initiative and problem -solving skills). 1.4. All new or changed job descriptions need to be formally HERA evaluated in order to determine the correct salary band for the post. HR will evaluate the job description within five working days of the receipt of all final and correct documentation. It is th e responsibility of the hiring manager to factor this in when planning the recruitment schedule. If an existing job description is changing, the manager should seek guidance from their HR Adviser or Partner before finalising the job description to determin e whether an updated HERA evaluation is required. 1.5. If the recruiting manager believes that there may be difficulty in recruiting to the role within current pay bands, they should contact their HR Adviser for guidance on appropriate courses of action. 2. Advertising 2.1. The School is committed to the fair and transparent advertising of new vacancies that encourages applications from the widest range of interested individuals, including existing staff. To support this, HR will provide key support and advice to recruiting m anagers in identifying and planning the most effective advertising campaigns for their vacancies. 2.2. The recruiting manager should create the vacancy using the School’s e -Recruitment system. This will include uploading electronic copies of the advert, job d escription and person specification. The advert should make clear to applicants the number and status of referees required and whether references will be sought before interview. The advert should also indicate whether a DBS check will be required for the role; the recruiting manager should contact their HR Adviser if they are unsure. 9 2.3. Creating the vacancy online will trigger an automatic email to the relevant Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) Manager, asking them to review the request and provide appr oval for funding. It is the recruiting manager’s responsibility to ensure that all correct and final information is included when submitting the request. Requests that are incorrect or incomplete will be rejected. 2.4. Subject to the FP&A Manager’s approval, an automatic email will then be sent to the HR Adviser who will be required to approve the vacancy before it is published. The HR Adviser will check through the documentation and may suggest amendments in order to comply with equality legislation and to en sure consistency throughout the School. The recruiting manager is responsible for making any required changes before publication. 2.5. Following approval by the FP&A Manager and HR Adviser, the recruiting manager will receive confirmation of the approval and t he HR Administrator will publish the advert. 2.6. The recruiting manager should indicate an initial recruitment schedule via the e -Recruitment system which includes the opening and closing dates for the advertisement, the date by which shortlisting will be co mpleted and the dates of interviews as well as of any additional tests or presentations. The relevant HR Adviser will ensure that the dates on the schedule are realistic and achievable for all parties involved. 2.7. In line with the School’s commitment to su pporting employees at risk of redundancy, the relevant HR Adviser will first check whether there are any individuals on the School’s Redeployment Register who should have priority access to the new vacancy. Where this is the case, those individuals will ha ve 24 hours to express an interest in the role before it is advertised more widely. 2.8. Where the role is to be advertised more widely, it will be placed on the School’s jobs webpa ge. Vacancies may also be placed on external sites and social media as appropr iate. Vacancies may also be advertised in specialist media, e.g. where they are more senior or require highly specific skills and/or experience, and/or social media. 2.9. Vacancies at band 9 and above should always be advertised externally, unless prior approval is given by the Director of HR. 2.10. The cost of advertising sh ould be appropriate to the level of the post and the difficulty of sourcing appropriately qualified applicants. HR will fund the cost of one advert on jobs.ac.uk as well as the reasonable cost of one further standard LSE -branded advert on another external website. 2.11. Recruiting managers should note that if the successful candidate is likely to require visa sponsorship, then the role will need to be advertised externally for at least 2 weeks, with screenshots taken once the advert is live. The recruiting manag er will also need to make a business case for sponsorship. Please refer to section 10 above for further information. 2.12. Further guidance about advertising may be found in the Recruitment Toolkit. 3. Recruitment panels 3.1. It is expected that selection for professional services roles will comprise at least two stages: a shortlisting stage followed by an interview stage. Selection will be made by a recruitment panel which, where possible, should comprise the same individuals at all stages. The recruiting manager should act as Chair of the panel. 3.2. The recruiting manager should aim to secure panel members before the post is advertised. The panel should normally include the line manager of the role (who will in many cases also be the recruiting manager) as well as another individual from the same department/division. 3.3. The following considerations apply to the composition of the recruitment panel: 10 • For roles at bands 1 -5, the panel should consist of at least two individuals. Fo r roles at bands 6-10, the panel should consist of at least three members, one of whom should be from a related division/department to give an objective view of the applicants, e.g. a user of a service which the post -holder will provide. • All panel members should normally be at least one salary band higher than the post being appointed to, unless permission is sought from HR to do otherwise. • At least one member of the recruitment panel (usually the Chair) must have attended the School’s recruitment and sel ection training. • All recruitment panels should have a mixed gender profile and, where possible, a mix of ethnicities. Where the panel is comprised of five or more people (i.e. for senior roles), the recruiting manager should ensure that the panel contains at least two panel members who identify as male and two panel members who identify as female. • It is not a requirement that an HR representative is part of a recruitment panel, either at shortlisting and/or at interviews, although they may join a panel w here appropriate. • Casual or agency staff should not be members of a recruitment panel. 3.4. Early consideration of panel composition is encouraged and the relevant HR Adviser can assist in finding a diverse mix of panel members where this is not easily achievable for the recruiting manager. 3.5. The Chair should make clear to the panel what is expected of them during the recruitment process, in line wi th this policy and procedure. 4. Shortlisting 4.1. A shortlisting process will apply to all competitive recruitment for professional services roles. A guide to shortlisting can be found in the Recruitment Toolkit, which includes points to consider when short listing and an example of a shortlisting grid. 4.2. The recruiting manager should ensure that shortlisting is completed in a timely fashion, remembering that applicants should normally be provided with at least five working days’ notice of an invitation to in terview. Shortlisting may begin as soon as applications are submitted; however, the final shortlist should only be confirmed after the closing date for the vacancy. The e - Recruitment system will send an automatic email notification to the panel members lis ted in the system once a vacancy has closed. 4.3. Each panel member should individually complete their shortlisting within the e -Recruitment system. In line with the School’s anonymised applications process, the personal details of applicants will be withheld from the panel at the shortlisting stage and will only be revealed once an applicant has accepted an offer for interview. For an applicant’s personal details to become visible, the invitation to interview must be scheduled using the e -Recruitment system. Shortlisting completed outside the e -Recruitment system must be re -uploaded correctly so that the information is interpreted correctly. Further guidance can be found in the Recruitment Toolkit. 4.4. HR does not issue hard copies of applications, although panel members may choose to print applications or download the shortlisting grid into an Excel spreadsheet. If shortlisting is completed manually, the shortlisting grid should be uploaded into the e -Recruitment system. 4.5. Each panel member should assess each applicant according to the shortlisting criteria. If an applicant meets a criterion, a tick should be entered in the corresponding box on the shortlisting grid; if they do not meet a criterion, a cr oss should be entered. If an applicant does not meet one of the essential criteria for the post, panel members do not need to continue shortlisting for that applicant. 4.6. Panel members are asked to provide brief comments on the shortlisting grid to explain why an applicant is shortlisted (or not), based on the essential criteria. This is a particular requirement for the UKVI in the event that any of the applicants require a work visa to work in the UK. 11 4.7. Panel members can create a longlist by selecting those applicants who meet all of the essential criteria. These applicants can then be assessed further against the desirable criteria. The final shortlist should be chosen fro m those applicants who best meet the essential criteria and, failing that, the greatest number of desirable criteria. As part of the School’s ‘Disability Confident’ accreditation, all applicants who have declared a disability and have opted in to the ‘guar anteed interview’ scheme should be invited to interview provided that they meet all essential criteria for the role. This information will be available to panel members when shortlisting. 4.8. Once all panel members have completed shortlisting, a final shortl ist should be agreed collectively. The Chair will provide final confirmation of the shortlist. In the event that no applicants are shortlisted, the recruiting manager should contact their HR Adviser for advice on re -advertising or the best alternative cour se of action. 4.9. Once the final shortlist is confirmed, the Chair should contact the shortlisted applicants using the e -Recruitment system to invite those applicants to interview. Guidance about how to do this is available on the HR webpages. As part of the invitation to interview, applicants will be asked if they require any reasonable adjustments to be made in order to attend (e.g. wheelchair access). Where a reasonable adjustment is requested, the recruiting manager may seek further advice from their HR A dviser. 4.10. Each applicant who receives an invitation will be given the option to select an interview time from the time -slots available. Each applicant’s identity will only be made available to the panel once they have selected their interview slot. The rec ruiting manager is responsible for ensuring that all panel members are available on the days and times offered to applicants. Once all shortlisted applicants have confirmed their attendance at interview, the Chair should finalise the interview schedule via the e -Recruitment system. An interview schedule for all confirmed interviewees can also be downloaded. The recruiting manager (or other nominated individual) is responsible for arranging the venue for the interview(s), including any catering or other admi nistrative requirements. 4.11. Candidates will be asked to bring with them to the interview evidence that they hold any qualifications listed as essential on the person specification for the role. Copies of qualifications taken for any candidates who are ultima tely unsuccessful at interview will be retained and disposed of in line with GDPR legislation. The recruiting manager should contact their HR Adviser for advice if a candidate has difficulty in providing evidence of a qualification. 4.12. In addition to a pan el interview, the recruiting manager may decide that candidates should undergo an additional form of assessment. This additional form may vary depending on the type and level of role, but could include a test (e.g. in -tray exercise, written test or Microso ft Office suite test) or a presentation. The recruiting manager is responsible for compiling any tests and for ensuring that they relate to the person specification and are a fair method of selection for the role in question. The recruiting manager is also responsible for booking the test/presentation venue and for making any necessary administrative arrangements. In most cases, any tests and/or presentations will be held on the same date as the interview. 4.13. For some roles, the recruiting manager may also w ish to consider psychometric testing for candidates, which may be conducted either before or after the interview. The recruiting manager should contact their HR Adviser in advance if they wish to consider this form of testing. It is expected that the cost of psychometric testing is covered by the department or division’s own budget. 4.14. For appointments at band 7 and above, where practical, candidates should have the opportunity to learn about the job role and work environment via discussions with key staff a nd/or by attending the School campus. For appointments at band 10, specific governance arrangements may apply to interview panels and the appointment process. In such cases, further advice should be sought from the Director of HR or the School Secretary. 12 5. Interviews 5.1. The School expects that interview panels will be used for the competitive recruitment of professional services roles, as part of a fair and transparent process of competition. As far as possible, interview panel members should consist of the same individua ls who completed the shortlisting for the role. 5.2. For professional services roles at band 7 and above, the panel at interview must include a Fair Recruitment Adviser. Further information about the Fair Recruitment Advisers initiative, including how to secure an Adviser for the panel, is available on the Fair Recruitment Advisers webpage or alternatively by contacting hr.fra@lse.ac.uk 5.3. It is recommended that members of the interview panel meet for at least 15 -30 minutes prior to the start of the interview(s) to finalise arrangements such as the order of the questions as well as which questio ns will be asked by which panel member. It is recommended that all candidates are discussed as a group after all interviews have finished, so that the panel members are in a better position to compare each candidate. During the interview, panel members a re encouraged to make notes on the candidate assessment sheets that may be referred to during the panel discussion. 5.4. The interview should also include additional questions that are framed around the School’s Effective Behaviours Framework, which supports the School’s Ethics Code and sets out core principles of behaviour underpinning life at the School. All new staff should be able to demonstrate that they can behaviour in accordance with these principles of behaviour. 5.5. Further guidance about interviews, i ncluding how to draft effective interview questions, can be found in the Recruitment Toolkit. 5.6. Reasonable interview expenses may be reimbursed in line with the School’s Interview Expenses Policy. 6. Unsuccessful candidates 6.1. The recruiting manager is responsible fo r updating the status of any unsuccessful candidates in the e -Recruitment system within five working days of the successful candidate accepting the offer. Once this update has been completed, the e -Recruitment system will send regret notifications to those individuals. It is essential that the outcome of interviews is captured in the e - Recruitment system so that accurate management information regarding recruitment is available. The recruiting manager (or nominated individual) is responsible for ensuring th at appropriate updates to applicant and candidate journeys are reflected in the e -Recruitment system. 6.2. Where requested, the recruiting manager should provide verbal feedback to unsuccessful interview candidates. The purpose of this feedback is to provide the candidate with meaningful comments that will help them to develop their skills for the future, as well as to leave them with a positive impression of the School. Where the feedback request is from an internal candidate, the recruiting manager is encour aged to give feedback in person as part of the School’s commitment to career development and support for existing staff. The recruiting manager may contact their HR Adviser for advice prior to giving the feedback. 6.3. In line with GDPR, notes made for all unsuccessful candidates should be retained by the recruiting manager for a period of 12 months following the conclusion of the recruitment process, after which they should be destroyed confidentially. 7. Making offers 13 7.1. The recruiting manager should make a v erbal offer to the successful candidate(s), subject to references where applicable. Once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the recruiting manager will need to complete the ‘Offer Checklist’ and ensure that a second fund check is undertaken using th e e-Recruitment system. A written offer of employment should not be sent until a second fund check has been completed. Guidance about how to do this can be found in the Recruitment Toolkit. 7.2. HR will prepare the offer of employment for the successful candidate, which will be sent out within three working days, once the ‘Offer Checklist’ and second fund check are completed. The offer of employment will include the proposed start date of the contract, which should always be a working day. 7.3. Once the successful candidate has accepted the offer of employment and a start date has been agreed, the line manager for the role should ensure that a comprehensive induction programme is put in place which should include both a local induction and the School’s Flying Start Induction. 8. Starting Salary 8.1. Once panel members have agreed on the successful candidate, the recruiting manager will need to consider the starting salary which is to be offered. The School's policy is to appoint at the bottom of the scale unless there is an exceptional case based upon the successful candidate’s skills and/or experience which justifies a higher starting salary. The existing salaries of staff in comparable roles should be taken into account when considering such cases. The recruiting manager should refer to the Starting Salary Policy and Procedure for further information; advice may also be sought from the relevant HR Adviser or HR Partner. 9. References 9.1. References should be taken up once a preferred candidate has been selected, and only after the offer has been accepted and the candidate has given permission for their referees to be contacted. References will not normally be required in the case of an off er of employment for an existing employee, unless this is specifically requested by the recruiting manager. 9.2. Appropriate referees are those who have direct experience of a candidate’s work, education or training: preferably in a supervisory capacity. One of the references obtained should be from the candidate’s current or most recent employer. References from relatives or friends should not be accepted. 9.3. The recruiting manager can request references via the e -Recruitment system for the successful candidat e; alternatively, HR will obtain references if requested by the recruiting manager. Any referees contacted through the e -Recruitment system will be asked to complete a ‘Reference Template’. The reference request should be accompanied by a copy of the job description and person specification of the role. 9.4. When requesting references, it is helpful to seek precise information and confirm facts, such as: • Length of employment • Relationship of the candidate to the referee • Job title • Brief details of responsibiliti es • Reasons for leaving • Performance • Unauthorised absence • Any other relevant information 14 In line with the Equality Act 2010, references should not enquire about a candidate’s sickness absence record unless an offer of employment has already been made. 9.5. Where an offer is made subject to satisfactory references, these must have been received before the individual starts employment. If the recruiting manager receives a reference which they consider unsatisfactory, they should contact their HR Partner for advic e on how to proceed. 9.6. Where possible, written references should be sought. In some circumstances, a telephone reference may be sought instead, for example where there are significant time pressures or where the location of a referee means that a telephone reference is more prac ticable to obtain. Where this is the case, the individual taking the reference should plan the conversation beforehand and have a list of questions ready. At the start of the conversation, the individual taking the reference should be certain as to the ide ntity of the person to whom they are speaking. A file note should be made at the time of the telephone conversation which should be dated and should be an accurate summary of what was discussed. 10. Appointments 10.1. Where possible, successful candidates should only start in post once satisfactory references have been received. Where these have not been received prior to the start date, the recruiting manager should contact their HR Adviser in case it is necessary to delay the start date. 10.2. New s tarters are required to provide evidence of their right to work in the UK no later than 9.30am on their first day of employment and prior to undertaking any work on behalf of the School. New starters will not be able to start employment or receive salary p ayments until they have produced evidence of their right to work in the UK. 10.3. On completion of the recruitment campaign, panel members must return all copies of any recruitment material (including references, application forms and CVs, and interview notes) to the Chair. 11. Review periods 11.1. All professional services staff newly appointed to the School will have a review period which will be stated in the offer of employment and which offers both the School and the individual the opportunity to assess their pe rformance. The duration of the review period will be six months for appointments at bands 1 -6 and one year for appointments at bands 7 -10. Where an appointment is made on a fixed -term contract basis, the duration of the review period may be adjusted as set out below: Length of fixed -term contract Duration of review period Less than six months Three months (or halfway through contract if shorter) Between six and twelve months Three months More than one year Six months 11.2. Formal review periods do not normally apply to successful internal candidates; this includes staff who are promoted, regraded or transferred to another post within the School. An informal review period will typically apply in these cases, as stated in the offer letter to the successful candidate. 11.3. The recruiting manager may request a formal review period where the new role is substantially different from the candidate’s previous role. The recruiting manager should speak with their HR Partner or Adviser if they are considering this; in such situations, the individual’s previous experience will be taken into account. 15 12. Further guidance and support 12.1. This policy and procedure is supported by the Recruitment T oolkit which is available on the HR webpages and includes guidance on how to use the School’s e -Recruitment system. 12.2. Advice and support on all matters relating to the funding of posts can be found on the Finance Division’s webpages. Queries relating to the funding of posts should be forwarded to the Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) Manager instead of HR. 16 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 1 year 30/06/202 4 31/12/2023 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 30/04/2016 Indi Seehra 2 30/10/2019 Indi Seehra 3 04/07/2023 Indi Seehra Links Reference Link Recruitment Toolkit https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/The -recruitment - toolkit Fair Recruitment Advisers https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/The -recruitment - toolkit/Fair -Recruitment -Advisers Contacts Position Name Email Notes Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': ' LSE Family Friendly Initiatives Frequent Asked Questions July 2017 What maternity leave and pay am I entitled to? There is a maternity leave calculator on the School’s intranet that can be found here. This will assist you to calculate your maternity leave entitlement and the earliest date you can begin your ma ternity. This does not however calculate the exact amount of pay you will receive. What happens if I’m sick during my maternity leave? If your sickness delays your return to work date, the normal sickness absence procedure should be followed. If you do not return to work before the end of the 26 weeks of Ordinary Maternity Leave and subsequently fall unwell, you will not eligible to receive Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), instead you would be able to resume your SMP or MA payments. What happens to my annual leave (AL) when I am on maternity leave? Your annual leave will continue to accrue during your whole maternity leave period. For example, if you took 52 weeks’ leave, you would accrue 41 days’ annual leave including Bank Holidays and Closure Days (pro -rata for part time staff). Employees often choose to use their accrued leave to facilitate a phased return to work, by working shorter weeks for a fixed time, ending unpaid leave early or tagging the leave on to the end of the maternity period to extend their time off. As normal, leave requests must be agreed by your line manager. You can find a Maternity Annual Leave calculator here. How much SMP do I receive if I have a multiple birth? You are only entitled to one SMP payment regardless of the number of children born. However, you may be entitled to Child Benefit for each child. Contact your local Benefits Agency for further details. Can I return part -time or to a job share? If you wish to apply for a flexible working arrangement following family friendly leave then you would need to do so in line with the School’s Flexible Working Policy and Procedure. Options may include part -time working or job share, where these options are appropriate and available and within the needs of the service provision. However, in the absence of such an agreement, you will be expected to return to your previous job under the same terms and conditions. Can I go back on maternity leave once I have returned to work if it’s still within the maternity leave period? No. Unless your child was born before the Sunday of the 29th week of pregnancy, once you have returned to work from your maternity leave you will not be able to go back onto Maternity Leave, paid or unpaid with respect to the birth of that child (or children). Su bsequent pregnancies will, of course, give rise to maternity leave rights associated with that separate pregnancy. What happens to my auto increment whilst I’m on leave? Your incremental date will not change due to going on any family friendly leave. If you are on fully paid leave, you will receive your auto increment within the next monthly pay. If you are on SMP or unpaid leave, your auto increment will kick in once you return to work. What happens if I have a stillbirth or miscarriage? If you have miscarriage or stillbirth at or after the start of the 16th week before the EWC, this will be treated as a confinement and the entitlement to maternity pay and leave will be the same as for a live birth. Where a miscarriage or stillbirth occurs before this date, the procedures relating to sickness absence will apply. If this is the case, you may wish to contact the staff counselling service, or your HR Partner. What happens if I decide not to return to work after my maternity leave? Will I have to pay back my maternity leave pay? You must provide written notice of resignation to the School, as per your contractual notice period. You will not be required to pay back your maternity leave. What happens if My Baby is born early? If your baby is born before the notified start date t hen the maternity leave will begin with the day after childbirth. You should advise your manager and the Pay Team in writing and within 28 days of the childbirth date, with a copy of the birth certificate as evidence of the date of birth. Can I take time off to attend antenatal appointments? Yes, you are entitled to paid time off during working hours to receive antenatal care. This is not restricted to medical examinations. It could, for example, include relaxation classes and parent craft classes as long as these are advised by a registered medical practitioner, registered midwife or registered health visitor. Fathers and partners also have a statutory right to unpaid time off to attend up to two antenatal appointments. If the father or partner involved with the pregnancy and baby is employed by the School they are entitled paid time off to attend up to two ante -natal appointments. You may be required to present your appointment card to your line manager. I have specific questions about Family Friendly leave, who do I need to speak to? You may contact your HR Adviser for advice or support regarding all types of family friendly leave. For advice regarding pay and your entitl ements, please speak to the Payroll Team. You can also find lots of information on the HR webpages under Family Friendly Leave, including all Family Friendly Policies and Procedures. What happens to my pension while I’m on Family Friendly Leave? Your pen sion contributions will continue as normal whilst you are on full pay. During a statutory pay period of leave you will not make any contributions but the School will continue to pay the normal contributions. During unpaid leave the contributions will freez e, however, you may be able to reimburse these when you return to work at the School. If you have any further queries, you can contact the Pensions Team. Can I work during my maternity leave? If you wish to work during your maternity leave, you may use your Keeping in Touch (KIT) day entitlement of 10 days. These may be used to attend team meetings, conferences, training, or to catch up on your workload. KIT days must be agreed mutually by you and your line manager. You may take these individually or in a block, however, please try to plan carefully. If you use a KIT day to come in for an hour meeting, you will be paid for that hour, however this will use up one KIT day from your allowance. What happens if my fixed term contract ends while I’m on maternity leave? If your work or funding is continuing then your fixed term contract should be renewed. If, however, your work or funding is not continuing then you will be informed by your line manage r that you are at risk of redundancy and the School’s redundancy procedure will be followed where applicable. If you are at risk of redundancy you will be offered the opportunity to join the LSE’s redeployment register to help you secure alternative employ ment at the School. Can I take shared parental leave at the same time as my partner? Parents can take up to a maximum of 50 weeks as SPL, and a maximum of 37 weeks of Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). You can take SPL at a different time from your partner/othe r parent, or at the same time. For example, a woman can be on maternity leave and her partner can be on shared parental leave at the same time. Dates must be agreed by both line managers (if both parents are employed at the School) and line managers may su ggest alternative dates. What can I do if I’m not entitlement to Paternity Leave? If you are not entitled to Paternity Leave, you may take annual leave or unpaid leave. This must be agreed by your line manager. What is the childcare voucher scheme? Childcare vouchers are an employee benefit for all members of staff. Part of your gross salary you exchange for childcare vouchers is tax -free and exempt from National Insurance contributions (NI) and because of this, you can make savings per parent, each ye ar. The School uses Computershare as their provider. You can find more information here. What happens to my sab batical leave whilst I’m on family leave? Sabbatical accrual will continue during any period of family friendly leave. What is Research Leave and am I entitled? If you are a member of Academic staff, employed under the terms and conditions of the New Aca demic Career you are entitled to a period of research leave following long -term absence from the School. The purpose of research leave is for Academic Staff members to re -establish their research trajectory following a long period of absence. If you have taken Maternity/Paternity/Shared Parental/Adoption leave for a total period of 18 weeks, you will be entitled to one term’s research leave. Research leave will normally commence on the first day of term, for the full term allowance, however this may be vari ed at the Head of Department’s discretion. You should discuss your research leave plans with your Head of Department. You can find more information on research leave here. '},\n",

       "  'text': '1 A guide for managers on how to support disabled staff in the SchoolPOCKET GUIDEResourcesHuma n REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS2 Introduction The School’s reasonable adjustment duty is fundamental to creating an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all staff. This pocket guide takes managers through a good practice approach to discussing, agreeing, implementing and reviewing reasonable adjustments. Employees who are anticipating a discussion about reasonable adjustments may also find this guidance useful in helping them to know what to expect. As well as general advice, this document also includes further detail on different types of adjustment as well as specific considerations that, as a manager, you may wish to take into account to help you to manage particular situations and conditions. This pocket guide incorporates good practice approaches as recommended by the Business Disability Forum (of which the School is a member) among other sources of support for disabled individuals. It should not be relied upon as a lone tool for addressing disability in the workplace. As a manager, you should also make use of the other available resources (including the Reasonable Adjustment Flowcharts) as well as contacting your HR Partner if you are unsure about how to address or manage a particular condition. In particular, you should be ready to be proactive - in conjunction with support from HR - in seeking expert advice, (such as via an Occupational Health referral) and, where appropriate, exploring different funding options (such as via Access to Work). This pocket guide is one of a number of guides that summarise the information and resources available on important HR topics. For further information about supporting disabled staff at LSE, please see the Disability Policy. 3 3Contents INTRODUCTION 2 WHAT IS A REASONABLE 4 ADJUSTMENT? DISCUSSING AND IMPLEMENTING 6 REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS GOOD PRACTICE TIPS 9 REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS 11 IN DETAIL Workstation adjustments 11 Adjustments to work pattern 13 Sensory support 15 OTHER WAYS OF 19 SUPPORTING STAFF FURTHER RESOURCES 19 4What is a reasonable adjustment? It is easy to think that treating everybody fairly means treating them the same. However, because of the barriers that disabled people face, as an employer the School has a legal obligation to treat disabled people more favourably to enable them to work effectively and productively – this is the essence of making a reasonable adjustment. Adjustments either remove or reduce the effect of barriers so that disabled staff can flourish at work. It’s important to note that what is ‘reasonable’ (or most appropriate) may vary depending upon the circumstances. In particular, consider whether a potential adjustment: • Will remove or reduce the disadvantage for the individual with the disability • Is practical to make• Is affordable (taking into account both funding available through the School and external sources, such as Access to Work) • Could harm the health and safety of others. Some reasonable adjustments might be more suitable for some circumstances (and conditions) than others. The following list is not exhaustive but should give you an idea of the different means that are available to support employees. • Making reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process (such as providing extra time during an interview or assessment) • Making reasonable adjustments to the physical environment, eg, widening a doorway or building a ramp • Exploring flexible working hours, either on a long-term or more temporary basis, for example changes to start/finish times, additional breaks, working from home • Acquiring or modifying equipment, eg, providing an adapted keyboard • Providing assistive software, as required for the role (such as speech-to-text software)• Where possible, providing information in alternative accessible formats (such as large print, audio or Braille) • In the case of academic and teaching staff, scheduling classes and/or rooms appropriately so that the needs of both students and the academic can be met as far as reasonably possible • In the case of an academic, making reasonable adjustments to their role (such as flexible working hours) that allow them to focus on all core elements of the role, ie, teaching, research and citizenship. 5• Supporting employees who become disabled, or whose disability leads to an absence from work, with a phased return (eg, working flexible hours) • Providing furniture, such as a specific chair or desk to support an employee with a physical disability • Providing additional management support (eg, one-to-ones) to an employee who has a mental health condition • Providing an employee with a support worker, eg, a sign language interpreter or reader • Allowing an individual with dyslexia more time to undertake a test for an interview • Reorganising minor or subsidiary pieces of work within the team• Transferring someone to a suitable alternative vacancy • Providing additional training or mentoring to support someone in being able to use equipment or access existing provisions • Modifying existing procedures or processes to ensure that a disabled member of staff does not suffer a disadvantage • Agreeing reasonable breaks during the working day, eg, for an employee with diabetes who needs to eat regularly • Allowing staff time off to attend medical appointments. As a line manager, you have a key role to play in supporting staff in a way which is appropriate to their circumstances, their role and the requirements of the team. You are not alone in this responsibility and you should make use of the support and advice available within the School. In particular, decisions about reasonable adjustments for staff should be made in conjunction with input from your HR Partner. While adjustments are often intended to support an individual in undertaking the core requirements of their role, they should not normally replace or discard those requirements. For example, while a disabled employee could be given more time to undertake a piece of work, it would not usually be considered reasonable to remove the need for that piece of work to be undertaken – unless it can be reallocated and replaced with other work at a similar level. Speak with your HR Partner if you aren’t sure whether a particular adjustment would qualify as “reasonable”. 6Discussing and implementing reasonable adjustments ■Having the conversation As a manager, there are a number of ways in which you could become aware that someone in your team has a disability: it could be as part of the induction process for a new starter, an employee could share this during a catch-up, it could be revealed through internal assessment (such as the workstation assessment coordinated by the Health and Safety team), or you could learn of it via a third party (eg, an HR Partner). Be aware that you also have a responsibility to be reasonably aware of possible health conditions and to address these accordingly, regardless of whether or not an employee has decided to share anything with you. Whatever form this sharing of information takes, your first step should be to meet with the employee for a supportive and collaborative conversation about what adjustments could support them in their role and during their time with the School in general. If you’re unsure how to approach this conversation, or have questions arising from a discussion you’ve recently had with someone in your team, contact your HR Partner. Depending on the circumstances, you may also seek additional advice or support from other areas of the School (eg, DTS) or external experts (eg, via an Occupational Health referral). Above all, approach the conversation sympathetically – whilst you may not get everything right first time, you should aim to constructively discuss what the employee’s needs may be and what measures might most suitably meet those needs. If the employee has only recently acquired their disability or you and the employee are unsure what adjustments are appropriate, further discussions may be necessary as both of you learn over time what adjustments work best. It’s also possible that the employee doesn’t yet have a formal diagnosis for their condition. In these circumstances, it’s important that you continue to support the employee during what can be a difficult time and manage accordingly, for example appreciating that the employee’s performance might be affected by stress or anxiety and taking this into account when you discuss work objectives. Alternatively, if the employee has been living with a disability for a long time, they may have considerable knowledge about their condition as well as a clear idea of what their needs are. In this instance, the employee may be able to provide existing information from medical personnel or other specialists who are already working with them, in addition to any new input which may be sought. 7As a manager, you should be open, responsive, and willing to trial different arrangements in order to properly support the employee. Remember that adjustment needs may be very individual. For example, two people with the same diagnosis may have different needs depending on their role and how the condition impacts them personally. You might also discuss what information the employee feels comfortable sharing with colleagues, at the same time appreciating that not everyone will feel comfortable doing so. Keep in mind that people might use different terminology to refer to themselves and any condition(s) they may have, and these terms may change over time. ■Agreeing and implementing the adjustment HR have developed a series of flowcharts for managers and staff that set out both the overall process for reasonable adjustments as well as more detailed processes for particular types of adjustment (such as workstation adjustments or sensory support). You may find it helpful to refer to these to understand the process to be followed. Where specialist advice is required (in particular an Occupational Health referral), this should typically be with the employee’s agreement. Your HR Partner can advise you on how make the referral. If there is a delay in specialist advice being obtained (for example if a disability has only recently become apparent), you should work with the employee to explore appropriate and reasonable options to support them until such advice has been received. Again, your HR Partner can support you here. You should also agree when the adjustment will be reviewed - in many cases, this will be informed by information from Occupational Health. Of course, asking how the employee is may well become a natural part of your catch-ups and one-to-one meetings, but you should also agree some dedicated time to discuss with the employee whether the adjustment is meeting their needs and (if not) what changes might help. Once an adjustment has been agreed it should be implemented without undue delay. In all cases, it’s very important that the employee is kept updated about what is happening. 8 ■Reviewing the adjustment Reasonable adjustments are not set in stone and you should expect to review them periodically. When putting the adjustments in place, discuss with the employee what would be a reasonable review period and what this will include. You must agree these reviews in advance with the employee and they should be fully involved during the review itself. Sometimes the timing of a review is determined by circumstances (eg, if the employee’s personal circumstances and/or role change). Where the arrangement is working well, a “review” could simply be a brief discussion with the employee, either in a regular one-to-one or separately, to see whether anything else could be helpful. Reviews should aim to identify the most appropriate support for the employee – taking into account both the initial assessment as well as any changes that have occurred in the intervening period – and they should be constructive, with the aim of minimising uncertainty and/or distress. As with all other aspects of the reasonable adjustment process, your HR Partner can provide guidance and advice about undertaking reviews. ■Change of line manager It is very important that disabled individuals can be confident that any agreed adjustments will stay even if their line manager changes. If you anticipate a change of role, you should discuss this with the individual and agree a handover with the incoming manager so that the employee’s support is not interrupted. 9Good Practice Tips Whatever the specifics of an individual case, here are some good practice tips that apply for all discussions about reasonable adjustments and disability support. ■Be prepared Reasonable adjustments can be a sensitive topic to discuss, but it’s vital that you don’t shy away from the discussion. Take the time to prepare – above all, make sure that you’re familiar with the School’s Disability Policy and contact your HR Partner if you’re unsure about any part of it. You should also sign up to the School’s training for managers, which includes specific training workshops and sessions that focus on tips and strategies to conduct sensitive or difficult conversations. ■Be proactive As a general principle, as a manager you should aim to be proactive in raising and addressing any issues or concerns. At the same time, make sure that you don’t prejudge the employee’s requirements. Remember that someone who has been living with a disability for a long time may have considerable knowledge about their condition as well as a clear idea of adjustments that would work best for them. It’s important that their views are central to any discussions and that they feel that any concerns they have are being treated seriously. You should also be open to the possibility that an unshared disability may be a factor in how someone works and/or behaves (for example if there are performance issues) – if you think that this might be the case, it’s important that you provide the employee with the opportunity to raise and discuss this if they feel comfortable doing so. ■There is no one-size-fits-all solution Just because someone has a particular condition, it doesn’t mean that they’ll need the same adjustments as someone else with the same condition. Discuss with the employee the barriers they’re experiencing and work together to identify adjustments that will help. You may need to seek expert advice on what’s possible and the most effective adjustment(s) – but the first step should always be talking with the employee to see if they have ideas about what they might need. Above all, don’t make assumptions or impose adjustments that the individual does not want. ■Adjustments shouldn’t be prescriptive Don’t impose adjustments unilaterally. Ask the employee what they need and – where reasonable – try to provide them what they’re asking for. Contact your HR Partner if you are unsure. 10 ■Use experts Line managers aren’t expected to be disability experts. At times, you’ll need help from an expert to work out precisely what sort of adjustment is needed. Not all disabled people will know exactly what adjustments they need – especially if they’ve only recently been diagnosed – and the adjustment process can be an opportunity for you (with help from specialists) to help them work it out. ■Try to resolve any differences early Staff may use the School’s grievance procedures if they wish to make a complaint related to reasonable adjustments (or any other aspect of their employment with the School). At the same time, while these formal procedures may well be appropriate in some cases, most issues concerning disabled staff may be addressed effectively and efficiently through early management intervention which prevents unnecessary escalation. ■Review and revise Any and all adjustments that are agreed should be reviewed on a timetable which you’ve agreed in writing with the employee and, where necessary, revised accordingly. As before, you may need to seek additional expertise to ensure that any revisions to the support are appropriate to the changing needs. 11Reasonable adjustments in detail This section provides some extra detail on different types of reasonable adjustments – it is by no means definitive and should be used alongside the Disability Policy and other written resources, as well as advice (including medical information) from within and outside the School as required. The section includes flowcharts to illustrate the process for exploring, agreeing and implementing different types of adjustment; please speak with your HR Partner if you are unsure how to proceed. ■Workstation adjustments Workstation adjustments involve making physical changes to the employee’s work environment. Depending on what is recommended by the available information, these could include: arranging a more ergonomic chair for the employee (or another piece of office furniture), changing the equipment they use for their role (such as replacing a desktop computer with a laptop), or otherwise adapting their work area. Health and Safety’s workstation assessment may help to identify necessary adjustments. Where further information is required, a referral via Occupational Health can help to shed more light on the nature of the employee’s condition. 12Reasonable adjustments flowchart: workstation adjustments Workstation adjustment Occupational Health referral arranged by line manager, supported by HR PartnerOther medical adviceWorkstation risk assessment May be supplied by employee Rearranged/ new office furniture (whether office-based or working from homeChange/ adaptation of computer (eg, Desktop to Laptop)Sensory support (eg, voice- recognition software) Consider funding options Total cost over £1,000?Yes Cost may be covered by Access to WorkNo Adjustment(s) implemented Review adjustment(s) and repeat process as requiredMay be informed by...

The School’s Flexible Working Toolkit and Policy are helpful for exploring what alterations to a work pattern could look like in practice. Depending on the circumstances, you could also agree with the employee on a shorter term or more fluid approach – for example, where they can work from home at short notice depending on the acuity of their condition at a given time, or where they work variable hours in different weeks. Also, keep in mind that rigid working hours can be a barrier to people with conditions that have a fluctuating impact at different times and might impact their wellbeing and/or productivity. 13 14Reasonable adjustments flowchart: adjustments to work pattern Adjustment to work pattern Workstation risk assessmentOther medical advice May be supplied by employee Employee may request and/or require...Assessment provided by Health and SafetyOccupational Health referral arranged by line manager, supported by HR PartnerMay be informed by...

This label can cover a wide range of personal circumstances, and a discussion about reasonable adjustments is likely to be informed by medical advice that can help to focus on the sorts of arrangements that will work best for the individual concerned. Routine and structure can be barriers for neurodivergent people for a number of reasons. Some people may have set routines that they rely on and will struggle to work in any other way. You may think that they are being inflexible, but even seemingly minor changes to established routines can be very distressing for them. For others, inflexible processes and tight deadlines will be a challenge. They might feel very anxious or unable to work effectively with a deadline looming. Rigid working hours can be a barrier to people with conditions that have a fluctuating impact at different times. 15 16Reasonable adjustments flowchart: sensory support Sensory support Workstation risk assessmentOther medical advice May be supplied by employee Employee may request and/or require...Occupational Health referral arranged by line manager, supported by HR PartnerMay be informed by...

While line managers are not expected to be experts in managing neurodivergence, here a few tips for how you can make sure that your team is welcoming, supportive and enabling. Be clear When someone new joins your team, be open and clear about the routines and structures that are already in place – formal and informal. Let them know that you’re open to discussing how these could potentially be amended so that the right support is in place for the employee. This may require you to assess frankly the routines and structures that are in place in your team. Sometimes, long- established processes can go unnoticed because you’ve been working with them for a long time – for example, receiving agenda papers for a meeting at late notice can be stressful for individuals with certain neurodivergent conditions, so you may wish to review this approach if it’s previously been an accepted practice in the team. Be flexible Let people set their own structures and routines, where it’s reasonably possible. What is “reasonable” will depend on the role, and there will be some roles for which it isn’t reasonable to allow this – for example, if certain routines and structures are in place for health and safety reasons, or if other colleagues rely on things being done a certain way. Your HR Partner can provide support and advice here. Equally, there will be some roles where flexibility in routine and structures is perfectly reasonable and may, in fact, be an improvement. This could be if, for example, a routine is established without any particular reason beyond being “the way that it’s always been done”, and it won’t have a disproportionate impact on the team to change it. Keep them in the loop Make sure that any changes to workplace routines (eg, different/finish start times or changes to shift patterns) are communicated as early as possible. Review regularly Check in regularly with your team. Make sure that you’re open to feedback about what is and isn’t working for them, and that you’ll support them by making whatever changes you can to help them. 18 ■Hypersensitivity Some people find too much sensory information overwhelming – this is sometimes called “hypersensitivity”. Stimuli could include: • Lighting, eg, fluorescent lighting in the office • Background chatter, especially in an open-plan office • Noise from computers and other technology• Patterned carpets and walls • Strong smells, such as fragrances or chemicals • Different textures. If an employee shares that they are hypersensitive, you should ask them what the causes are. Remember that these will vary from person to person and from place to place – what’s fine for one person may cause another person to feel overwhelmed, and that same person might feel very different in one place compared to another. ■Hyposensitivity Some people can also be “hyposensitive”, which means that they’re less sensitive to sensory stimuli. This means that they might not be able to hear or distinguish certain sounds such as speech, or feel pain in the way you might expect. ■Some common adjustments Naturally, your first step should be an open and honest discussion with the employee – they’ll be able to tell you what sort of sensory sensitivities they have, and what would help. Some of the more common adjustments for individuals with sensitivity to sensory stimuli include: • Quieter working areas (working some of the time from home can be helpful here); • Flexible hours, such as working from home during busier times • Changed hours (eg, starting/finishing earlier) to avoid busier times of the day • Putting rules in place to avoid crosstalk in meetings• Making changes to the physical environment, such as replacing fluorescent lighting with alternatives or installing flexible lighting • Considering the amount of visible information in the office – for example, having word clouds on the walls can be overwhelming for some people • Sharing the employee’s routine with the rest of the team (if they agree). If the employee is hyposensitive, they may benefit from alternative ways of communicating – such as speech-to-text software if they struggle to distinguish speech. Potential solutions can be discussed by contacting the DTS Service Desk. 19Other ways of supporting staff As well as supporting with suitable reasonable adjustments, you should also know how to signpost disabled staff to the other wellbeing resources available within the School, including: • The Mental Health First Aiders’ Network: the School has a network of over 200 volunteers, each trained to understand the factors that can affect mental health. The Network is supported by a number of Mental Health Staff Champions who act as local champions in promoting a positive culture around mental health and wellbeing at LSE. • The School’s Staff Counselling service, which can be contacted at 020 7955 6953 (or just extension 6953) or at staff. counselling@lse.ac.uk• The Employee Assistance Programme (EAP): all staff can access trained counsellors and support specialists. The EAP can be contacted in confidence by calling 0800 107 6147 (quoting LSE as the name of the employer) or accessing the online portal by visiting www. colleaguesupport.co.uk (entering code 206011 as the username and password). • The Business Disability Forum website includes a range of resources for employers (and by extension managers), including factsheets on different conditions and suggested adjustments. Please contact your HR Partner if you would like to know more. Further resources This pocket guide is one of a number of resources to support managers and staff in managing disability and in ensuring that disabled staff can play a full role in the School. Managers should also consult the Disability Policy and other relevant policies as required. Both managers and staff are encouraged to provide feedback on these resources, for example via their HR Partner or the Disability and Wellbeing Network (DAWN). 20info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/ Human-Resources LSE Human Resources Lionel Robbins Building 5th Floor, Houghton Street London WC2A 2HD E: humanresources@lse.ac.uk T: +44 (0)20 955 6659 '},\n",

       "  'text': \"1 Policy The School's policy in relation to sickness absence is to support employees by paying sick pay and investigating absence in conjunction with the sickness absence procedure. This will normally be carried out through return to work interviews and the referra l of employees for occupational health assessments primarily in cases of long -term or recurring short-term absences. The aim of such a referral is to provide the necessary support to enable the employee to return to work and/or continue working in their po st where reasonably practicable. Procedure The procedure is intended to: \\uf0a7 provide a sympathetic, equitable and consistent process for dealing with employees whose attendance or work performance are affected by ill health in order to ensure as far as poss ible that they are given the necessary support to enable them to attend work on a substantive basis; \\uf0a7 encourage regular and appropriate communication between an ill employee and his/her manager, and, where appropriate, the HR Division; \\uf0a7 ensure that, where an employee's attendance or work performance are affected by ill health, appropriate steps are taken to ascertain the nature of that illness, and that no decision is taken concerning his/her employment without consultation with him/her. In order to ensure as far as possible that employees are treated fairly and consistently in accordance with the policy and procedure, all sickness absence must be reported to Human Resources. Both managers and employees are responsible for ensuring that th ey are fully aware of Capability health procedure for academic support staff Operational 2 their obligations for reporting sickness absence as detailed in the Sickness Absence Procedures. Hard copies are available on request. 1. Scope of the procedure a) This procedure applies to all Academic Support Staff. b) Only wor k performance problems arising from an employee's ill health will be dealt with under this procedure. Performance problems arising from any other cause shall be resolved in accordance with the appropriate disciplinary or capability procedure. c) The definition of a manager for the purposes of this procedure is any employee of the School, including Heads of Departments, with line management responsibility for one or more members of the academic support staff. d) Formal resolution of operational problems a rising from an employee's capability - health must always be sought by means of this procedure unless another procedure is more appropriate (see section 3). 2. Exclusions a) This procedure does not apply to employees during their review period of employ ment with the School, or extension thereof (see Review Periods, Guidance for Managers and Employees). However, where performance problems are a result of ill health, medical information shall be obtained in accordance with sections (6 -8). b) This procedu re does not apply to: • underperformance/absence that can be attributed to a deliberate failure, and/or negligence or other forms of misconduct that may more appropriately be dealt with under the Disciplinary and Dismissals Procedure for Academic Support St aff • underperformance that is not attributed to a medical condition and which may more appropriately be dealt with under the Capability Policy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff. c) Should it become apparent at any stage of using this procedure that the issues being addressed are alcohol or drugs -related, a manager may decide to suspend the use of the Capability - Health Procedure if an offer of referral for assessment and advice on treatment is accepted. If this offer is declined, then the Capabilit y - Health Procedure shall continue as normal. In such cases, reference should be made to the Alcohol and Drugs Policy and Procedure. 3. Roles and responsibilities 3 a) Employees have a responsibility to: • ensure that they follow the appropriate sickness absence procedures should they fall ill (see paragraph 1(c)). • provide a medical certificate in accordance with the Schools sickness absence procedures (see paragraph 1(c)) after a period of continuous absen ce exceeding the maximum for the self- certification of absence due to ill health. • take all reasonable steps to attend either an Occupational Health referral or capability - health hearing arranged under this procedure. b) Failure to comply with these re sponsibilities could prevent the School from offering support it might otherwise be able to provide and may lead to disciplinary action or affect the employee's occupational sick pay. c) Managers have a responsibility to: • Monitor attendance levels and patterns of absence of their staff. • Contact your HR Partner where stress is the reason given for an absence, so that steps can be taken to find out if there are any work -related issues that need to be addressed. In such cases, managers should also refer to the Guidance on Managing Pressure and carry out a Stress Audit. • Ensure that they are in regular communication with a member of staff on sick leave. This includes maintaining contact with an employee who is on long -term sick ness. • Conduct informal return -to-work discussions, in private, with staff returning to work after a period of sickness absence, whether short or long -term. Such discussions should certainly be held on the return to work of any member of staff whose attend ance is a matter of concern. The purpose of return to work discussions is to ascertain the reasons for the sickness absence, whether further absences for the same or related reasons can be anticipated, and whether any support can be provided to the employe e to ensure that such absence is kept to a minimum. • Where necessary, remind employees of the expected standards of attendance and warn them that formal action might be necessary if there is no improvement. • Confirm the content and outcome of return -to-work discussions in writing. • Request a medical assessment promptly and arrange a capability health hearing in cases of long -term absence/illness or where the outcome of a return to work interview has not resulted in an improvement in the level of short -term absence. • Take account of any medical evidence supplied by, or on behalf of, the employee concerned. d) To ensure consistency of the application of this procedure, managers must seek the advice of their HR Partner before making any decisions. Guidance on return -to-work interviews can also be provided by your HR Partner. e) Should an employee need assistance in understanding either the policy or procedure or any documentation in connection with this, he/she should seek advice from their HR Partner or a trade union representative. HR does not provide employees with specific advice relating to individual circumstances. 4 4. Capability - health a) Where an employee's ill health, or the pattern or level of his/her absence due to ill health affects his/her ab ility to carry out the duties that s/he has been employed to perform, it shall be regarded as a capability - health problem, which may be short or long term. Short -term absence due to ill health b) For the purposes of this procedure, a short -term absenc e due to ill health is one up to the maximum length of time covered by the self -certification procedure for reporting absence due to illness (ie. an absence of up to seven calendar days). If such short -term absences persistently recur, a total of three such absences within any period of three calendar months shall be regarded prima facie as falling within the scope of this procedure. Long -term absence due to ill health c) A long -term absence due to ill health shall be a period of continuous absence excee ding the maximum length of time covered by the self -certification process for reporting absence due to ill health (ie. an absence of eight or more calendar days). Performance problems resulting from long -term ill health d) Performance problems are resol ved by means of the appropriate disciplinary or other procedures. However, employees may sometimes be affected by long -term ill health, which, though insufficiently serious to prevent them from attending work regularly, is serious enough to undermine their long -term work performance. In such cases, the provisions of this procedure will apply. 5. Medical assessment a) It is important to ascertain accurately the medical position regarding an employee before making decisions relating to his/her future employment. b) Where: • a regular pattern of short -term sickness absence has been identified by an employee's manager, or; • an employee is absent from work due to long -term ill health, or; • the performance of an employee attending for work is affected by long -term ill health; or • there are concerns regarding the impact of work on the health of an employee; 5 and where it h as been established that resolution of the operational problems caused by such ill health cannot be achieved by informal means, the manager will consult with their HR Partner, who may, if appropriate, request a medical assessment of the employee. c) An o ccupational health doctor external to the School will conduct the medical assessment. The employee will be advised, in writing, by the occupational health provider that such an assessment has been requested and the time, date and location of the appointmen t. d) The employee will be asked to sign a medical consent form, allowing a summarised report to be sent to the School. e) It may be possible to refer the employee to an alternative, mutually acceptable medical specialist, if the employee can give good reason why a referral to the recommended occupational health doctor would not be appropriate. The School may also suggest a referral to an alternative medical specialist where an occupational health assessment is not considered to be appropriate. f) The School shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that such a referral is arranged in good time, and the employee will be expected to co -operate in this process. The unavailability of an alternative medical specialist will not be an acceptable ground for d elaying a capability - health hearing indefinitely. g) It is usually considered reasonable to request employees who are absent due to ill health to attend such an assessment, and where necessary the School will arrange transport, including the reimbursem ent of any costs incurred to enable them to attend. h) Where an employee refuses to attend a medical assessment, a decision will be made on the basis of the information available, which could result in a disciplinary or capability - health hearing. 6. Purpose of the medical assessment a) The purpose of the medical assessment is better to understand the nature of the employee's ill health, and its implications for his/her future attendance or work performance. On its completion, a report shall be forwar ded to HR. b) The report shall seek to provide the following information: • the nature of the ill health; • the estimated level of sickness absence likely to arise from the ill health; • the likely employment significance of any underlying medical condition and treatment; • the likelihood, and timescale, of a full return to work; • any adjustments that might reasonably be made to the employee's job or work environment that will facilitate a sustained return to work. 6 7. Report from the employees GP or specialist a) As part of the medical assessment, a report from the employee's GP or a relevant hospital specialist may be sought by the occupational health doctor. This is to ensure that all a vailable, appropriate, information has been obtained before decisions affecting the member of staff's employment are made. b) Such reports shall be sought only after HR has obtained agreement to this from the employee, using the standard medical consent form. This form shall normally be sent to the employee with the letter confirming their referral for a medical assessment. c) The employee has the following rights in relation to any medical report provided by his/her GP or Specialist: • to withhold consent to the obtaining of such a medical report, in which case the School would be obliged to act solely on the basis of the inform ation available to it, and the employee would be advised of that fact; • to request to see any medical report before it is sent to the School; the employee will then have 21 days in which to do so before it is sent; • to request that any medical report seen by him/ her be altered before issue, or, if the GP or relevant hospital specialist is not willing to comply with such a request, to add a statement of his/her own. 8. Outcome of the medical assessment a) On receipt of the medical assessment, HR shall in form the employees manager of the relevant facts from the report. On the basis of these facts, the manager shall decide on the appropriate course of action, in consultation with Employment Relations. This will be: • to take no further action, in which case the employee will be formally advised as such; • to consider the employee's absence, or poor performance, as a case for possible disciplinary action, should the medical assessment establish that there is no underlying medical reason for it. In this case, th e employee will be formally advised as such, and an investigation commenced in accordance with the appropriate disciplinary procedure; • to deal with the issues informally, where the report indicates that there are minor short - term problems that can be easi ly resolved; • to convene a short -term capability - health hearing in cases of short -term absence; • to request that a long -term capability - health hearing be convened in cases of long -term absence or poor performance. b) The employee may have access to t he medical assessment, on request to their HR Partner, and make observations on its content. c) The medical assessment shall be considered at any formal capability - health hearings subsequently arranged. d) Where the decision is that a capability - health hearing should be held, the manager shall write 7 a report, including the Occupational Health report, commenting on the recommendations made in it, normally within fifteen days of receiving the medical report. Employees will be notified in cases where it is not possible for the report to be written within this timescale. Once completed, the report shall be submitted to the next most senior manager in cases of long -term capability - health hearings. Capabilty -health hearings 9. Notification procedures a nd right of accompaniment a) Where it is considered that either a short -term or long -term capability - health hearing is necessary, the manager convening the hearing, will write to the employee giving five working days' notice of the time, date and locat ion of the capability meeting or hearing, and details of the matter to be considered, together with any documentation necessary to prepare his/her response. This will normally comprise the line manager's report and a copy of this procedure. This is to allo w the employee sufficient time to prepare a response. b) In the case of long -term capability - health hearings, the employee shall also be advised if a potential outcome of the hearing is termination (see paragraphs 18(b) and (c) below). c) The employee shall be advised of his/her entitlement to be accompanied at the hearing by a work colleague or trade union representative. Capability - health hearings are internal proceedings; therefore attendance is restricted to employees of the School or representat ives of recognised trade unions. Solicitors and any other non -employees many not attend capability - health hearings. d) Should the employee wish to be accompanied or call witnesses, it will be his/her responsibility to provide all the appropriate detail s, including the date, time and location of the hearing, as well as the details and documentation relating to his/her case. e) Employees must advise their HR Partner of the name(s) both of the person accompanying them to the hearing and any witnesses at least 24 hours prior to the hearing. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 10(c), the School will consider any reasonable suggestion from the employee concerning representation at the hearing. f) The companion will be able to confer with the employee du ring the hearing and will be allowed to address the meeting or hearing in order to put forward and sum up the employee's case, respond on the worker's behalf to any view expressed at the hearing and ask questions for clarification of any witnesses. The com panion will not be able to answer questions on the employee's behalf. g) An employee shall take all reasonable steps to attend the hearing. Should the chosen companion be unavailable on the given date, the employee shall immediately request a postponemen t by proposing an alternative date and time, which should be within five working 8 days of the given date. Where this is not possible, the employee shall choose an alternative person to accompany him/her to the hearing. h) If the reason for the employee or companion being unable to attend the hearing is for reasons that were unforeseeable at the time of arranging the hearing, the employee will be notified of a new date, time and location by the Chair of the hearing. In cases where hearings are rearranged, i t will not be necessary to provide a further five working days notice of the date, time and location. Provided the specified notice has been given, the School reserves the right to hold capability - health hearings in absentia. i) Whilst in the sensitive situation of long -term ill health, it may be more difficult for the employee to attend the hearing in person, it is preferable that he/she does so, and appropriate arrangements, including travel arrangements, shall be made, where requested. j) The circu mstances of any action to be taken regarding a representative of a recognised trade union will be notified to a full time officer of that union. 10. In attendance a) The formal stages of the capability - health procedure (see sections 12 - 17) are designed to allow a case to progress through the normal management chain. b) The Stage 1 short -term capability - health hearing shall be chaired by the employee's line manager. The line managers manager will normally chair the Stage 2 and 3 short -term and all long -term capability - health hearings with the line manager attending to present the management case. c) In certain cases, it may be necessary for a manager other th an the immediate line manager/his/her line manager to chair the hearing. In such circumstances, the employee will be advised of the reasons why this is the case. d) The manager chairing the hearing will be accompanied by a member of Employment Relations acting as advisor and a second member of Human Resources Division, who will take a written record of the hearing. 11. The procedure at capability -health hearings a) The Chair will explain the purpose of the hearing, introduce the parties and outline the procedure. b) The management representative will then present his/her case*. c) He/she may then be questioned, for the purposes of clarification, through the Chair of the hearing by the employee and by the Chair. 9 d) The employee or companion will th en be invited to state his/her case*. *Employees and Management Representatives can call witnesses to support their case, either during their statement or after questioning has taken place. If witnesses are called they may only be present for the period o f their statements and questioning. They will be questioned first by the person who called them, then in turn by the other side, the Chair and Employment Relations representative, if necessary. The Chair of the hearing reserves the right to call further wi tnesses at any stage of the hearing, if he/she feels that it would be helpful to do so for clarification. e) The employee may be questioned, for the purposes of clarification, by the Chair and by the management representative through the Chair. It should be noted that employees, not companions, will be required to answer questions put to them during the hearing. f) After each side's case has been presented and each party has had the opportunity to ask questions of clarification, the Chair will ask the employee, and then the management representative to sum up. g) The hearing will then be adjourned while the facts o f the case are considered, and a decision made by the Chair. The hearing shall normally be reconvened on the same day for the decision to be given orally to the employee; however if the Chair requires additional time in making the decision, the hearing may be reconvened the following day. h) The employee should receive written notification of the outcome within five working days of a capability - health hearing; this notification shall inform the employee of his/her right of appeal, along with a copy of th e Appeals Procedure. Short -term capability -health 12. Stage one: short -term capability -health hearing a) Where a regular or persistent pattern of short -term absence is leading to operational difficulty, and where it has been established from the medica l assessment report that such absence is related to ill health, the employee's manager shall convene a Stage 1 Short -term Capability - Health Hearing. b) At the hearing, the manager shall explain the purpose of the hearing and detail the instances of abs ence (for example, the number of days, the period over which the absence has occurred, the pattern of absence, etc.), together with the reasons why the absence is giving cause for concern. Reference will be made to the medical assessment report and informa l steps that have been taken to try to address the absence as appropriate. c) The employee, or his/her companion, shall then be given an opportunity to ask questions for the purposes of clarification, comment on the managers concerns, raising any relevan t factors 1 or proposals that should be taken into account when deciding on future action. Reference may be made to any additional medical evidence provided by the employee, as long as it has been submitted at least twenty- four hours before the meeting. d) When the manager has heard all the facts, and is in a position to decide upon a course of action, the options as set out in section 16, shall be considered. e) Where a capability - health warning is issued and the standards specified in the improvement plan have not been met or maintained, a decision should be taken as to whether to extend the review period in the event that significant progress has been demonstrated, or to progress to Stage 2 of the formal procedure by recommending that a Stage 2 Short -term Capability - Health Hearing be held. If the required standards have been met, the employee shall be advised in writing and the usual monitoring arrangements shall resume. 13. Stage two: short -term capability -health hearing a) The line manager shall submit a report to the manager who is to chair the Capability - Health Hearing, and all supporting documentation shall be appended to the report. The report will outline the outcomes of the monitoring process to date, identify furthe r required improvements and make recommendations for any further support that could be provide to help the employee reach the standard(s) specified. Where necessary, further medical information shall be sought and included with the report. b) The letter from the Chair convening the hearing should make clear that the possible outcomes of the hearing could include a final capability - health warning. c) When the manager has heard all the facts, and is in a position to decide upon a course of action, the o ptions as set out in section 16, shall be considered. d) Where a capability - health warning is issued and the standards specified in the improvement plan have not been met or maintained, a decision should be taken as to whether to extend the review peri od in the event that significant progress has been demonstrated, or to progress to Stage 3 of the formal procedure by recommending that a Stage 3 Short -term Capability - Health Hearing be held. If the required standards have been met, the employee shall be advised in writing and the usual monitoring arrangements shall resume. 14. Stage three: short -term capability -health hearing a) The line manager shall submit a report to the manager who is to chair the Capability - Health Hearing, and all supporting do cumentation shall be appended to the report. The report will outline the outcomes of the monitoring process to date, including an assessment of whether the employee can reach the required standard(s). Where necessary, further medical information shall be s ought and included with the report. 1 b) The letter from the Chair convening the hearing should make clear that the possible outcomes of the hearing could include dismissal with notice. c) When the manager has heard all the facts, and is in a position to decide upon a course of action, the options as set out in section 16, shall be considered. 15. Possible outcomes of hearings held under the short - term capability -health procedure a) Any or several of the following may be possible outcomes of a short -term capability - health meeting and/or hearing, but the list is not necessarily exhaustive. • No further action, in which case the employee would be formally advised as such. • A review period during which the circumstances relating to the individuals health will be monitored, in which event the length and objectives of such reviews shall be agreed and specified. • An agreed improvement plan, setting the objectives to be attained over a specified review period. • Consistent with the School's obligations under th e Disability Discrimination Act 1995, if the medical advice is that the employee would be able to attend work on a substantive basis if reasonable adjustments were made to the place of work and/or method of work, consideration shall be given to whether this can be reasonably accommodated, and arrangements shall be made accordingly, along with an agreed review period (see section 19). • First Capability - Health Warning following a Stage 1 Short -term Capability - Health Hearing. It will include an agreed impr ovement plan as above and will warn that action under Stage 2 of the procedure will be considered if there is no satisfactory improvement. • Final Capability - Health Warning following a Stage 2 Short -term Capability - Health Hearing. It will include an agr eed improvement plan as above and will warn that dismissal under Stage 3 of the procedure will be considered if there is no satisfactory improvement. • Termination of contract on grounds of capability - health following a Stage 3 Short -term Capability - Health Hearing where the employee has been unable to achieve, or to maintain the required attendance improvements agreed at the previous short -term capability - health hearing. b) Where the medical assessment is one of permanent ill health, early retirement on grounds of ill health shall be arranged wherever possible, bearing in mind the consideration of whether the employee belongs to one of the Schools pension schemes. c) Following the capability - health meeting or hearing, the employee will be advised in writing of the decision and reasons for it within five working days, including the right of appeal. Where termination of contract was the outcome of the hearing; the letter will also include the termination date and details of the appropriate period of notice. 1 Long -term capability -health 16. Long -term capability -health hearings a) Where long -term absence, performance problems or a combination of long and short -term absence are causing operational difficulty, and where it has been established by means of the medical assessment report that such absence or performance problems are due to ill health, a long -term hearing shall be convened. b) The hearing shall begin with the presentation of the management case by the employee's line manager. This should outline, with reference to the medical assessment report, the nature of the employee 's ill health, the details of any absence arising from it, and its operational impact. Reference should also be made to all informal attempts to resolve the situation (for example, return -to-work discussions, counselling sessions or previous medical referr als). c) Either the employee or his/her representative shall then be given the opportunity to respond to the management case, with reference to any medical evidence he/she has obtained. To be considered at the hearing, such medical evidence must first be presented to Employment Relations at least 24 hours prior to the hearing. d) During the course of both presentations, and at their conclusion, the Chair may question both parties for purposes of clarification. Each party may question the other for purpo ses of clarification, if necessary through the Chair. Both parties shall be given the opportunity to sum up, with the managers summing up being given last. e) When all the facts of the case have been presented, the hearing shall be adjourned to enable the Chair to reach a decision. The hearing shall normally be reconvened on the same day for the decision to be given orally to the employee; however if the Chair requires additional time in making the decision, the hearing may be reconvened the following day. The decision shall be confirmed in writing, normally within five working days of the hearing. 17. Possible outcomes of long -term capability -health hearings a) Any or several of the following may be possible outcomes of a long -term capability -health hearing, but the list is not necessarily exhaustive. • No further action, in which case the employee would be formally advised as such. • Monitoring and review of the s ituation, depending on the circumstances of the case, in which event the length and objectives of such reviews shall be agreed and specified. • An agreed improvement plan, setting the objectives to be attained over a specified review period. This would be a ppropriate in cases of under -performance. • Consistent with the School's obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, if the medical advice is that the employee would be able to return to work on a limited 1 basis, or that he/she would be able to do so if reasonable adjustments were made to the place of work and/or method of work, consideration shall be given to whether this can be reasonably accommodated, and arrangements shall be made accordingly, along with an agreed review period (see section 19). • Where the medical assessment is one of permanent ill health, early retirement on grounds of ill health shall be arranged wherever possible, bearing in mind the consideration of whether the employee belongs to one of the School's pension schemes. b) Inability by the employee to achieve, or to maintain, attendance or performance improvements agreed at a long -term capability - health hearing could lead to a further hearing being convened. At this subsequent hearing, consideration may be given to the te rmination of the employee's contract of employment on grounds of capability - health. c) Alternatively, where the medical assessment indicates continued long -term absence of such duration that the School could not reasonably be expected to wait for recov ery, the conclusion may be reached that it would be inappropriate to draw out the process with further long -term capability - health hearings. In such circumstances, and where ill health retirement was not a viable option, a decision may be taken to termin ate the employee's contract of employment, if appropriate. d) Following the capability - health hearing, the employee will be advised in writing of the decision and reasons for it within five working days, including the right of appeal. Where termination of contract was the outcome of the hearing, the letter will also include the termination date and details of the appropriate period of notice. 18. Making reasonable adjustments a) The School is committed to supporting employees who are unable to return to or continue with their full duties due to ill health by making appropriate adjustments to their role, where this is considered to be reasonable operationally and where medical advice indicates that this will enable the employee to return to their subst antive duties within a reasonable timescale. b) Such adjustments will be in conjunction with medical advice received and may include phased return to work, reduced duties or a variation in working hours. Adjustments will normally be made on a temporary b asis, but permanent adjustments will be considered where this is considered to be reasonable operationally. c) The period of the adjustments will be set in conjunction with the medical advice and progress will be monitored throughout to ensure that the e mployee is likely to be able to return to the agreed duties at the end of the period. Should this not be possible a further capability - health hearing will be held and additional medical advice may be sought, where appropriate. This may result in termination of the employee's contract if alternative work or ill health retirement are not possible options. d) During the period of adjustment, the employee will be paid either his/her sick pay entitlement or for the work being carried out, whichever is higher. The employee shall continue to submit 1 medical certificates for the period of adjustments and may be requested to attend further Occupational Health appointments if it is felt that this would be helpful. 19. Alternative employment a) Where medical advice indicates that an employee is not fit to return to his/her current post but alternative work would be possible, the School shall consider whether there is any suitable alternative employment. b) In order to determine what would const itute suitable alternative employment, the employee shall be asked for details regarding his/her experience and qualifications. This will be used, in conjunction with the medical advice, in assessing vacancies that are available at that time and for a reas onable time period afterwards, normally no longer than two months. c) Support shall be given to the employee by HR by identifying possible vacancies, helping the employee to find out more information if appropriate and discussing the employee's suitability for the post with the recruiting manager. Unless there are serious concerns about the employee's suitability for the post based on the application form, the employee shall be invited to interview, the purpose of which will be to assess whether or not th ey could satisfactorily undertake the full range of duties for the post. d) The job description and person specification will be sent to the Occupational Health doctor to confirm that the post is suitable in terms of the employee's medical condition. This should normally take place prior to the employee being interviewed for the post. e) If the employee is appointed to the post, this will be subject to a trial period, normally of three months. During the trial period, progress should be continually reviewed and monitored. Where the trial period is not successful, the employee will revert to the capability - health process to consider the remaining options of ill health retirement or termination of contract. f) If, following the trial period, there are further problems in attendance and/or performance due to the same reasons; the employee will revert to the capability - health process when the options of ill health retirement or termination of contract will be considered. If the problems are due to a dif ferent reason, the capability - health process will consider all possible options. g) Should the employee not be successful in finding alternative work within a reasonable timescale, he/she will revert to the capability - health process when the remainin g options of ill-health retirement or termination of contract will be considered. 20. Termination payments a) Where an individual's contract of employment is terminated in accordance with this procedure, such termination shall be with full contractual pay in lieu of notice. 1 b) An amount equivalent to any outstanding entitlement to occupational sick pay shall also be paid, which, in cases of disability or injury, will not be subject to tax. c) Consideration may be given by the employee's organisatio nal unit to the payment of an ex - gratia termination payment, equivalent to one week's pay for every completed year of service, up to a maximum of ten years. d) However, ex -gratia payments cannot be guaranteed, and are subject to budgetary constraints and the circumstances of the particular case. 21. Appeals and grievances a) Employees should refer to the separate Appeals Procedure for information about the right to appeal against decisions made in accordance with this procedure and the steps to be followed in doing so. b) Where a grievance is raised in connection with the Capability -Health Procedure it will be considered under the Appeals Procedure for Academic Support Staff. 1 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 123 00/00/00 00/00/00 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 123 00/00/00 abc abc 123 00/00/00 abc abc Links Reference Link 123 abc 123 abc Contacts Position Name Email Notes abc abc abc@lse.ac.uk abc Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

This Part enables the Standing Committee, as the appropriate body, to d ismiss any member of the academic staff by reason of redundancy. BYELAW 1 While the Academic Annex procedure gives effect to the purpose of Part II, it is the School\\'s policy to ensure as far as possible security of employment for its members. However it is recognised that they may be circumstances beyond the School\\'s control which may affect staffing requirements. It is the School\\'s agreed aim to maintain and enhance the efficiency with which its core purposes are carried out in order to safeguard the curr ent and future employment of its members. The School, in consultation with the Local Association of the AUT, as the recognised Trade Union for staff covered by the \"Academic Annex\\', shall where possible seek ways to avoid redundancies and, where this is no t possible, to minimise the impact of such redundancies which prove unavoidable through the provision of sufficient time and effort to finding alternative employment for staff made redundant. The School shall also seek to handle all compulsory redundancies in the most fair, consistent and sympathetic manner possible and to minimise as far as possible any hardship that may be suffered by the employees concerned. Exclusion from Part II of persons appointed or promoted before 20 November 1987 9. (1) Nothing in this Part shall prejudice, alter or affect any rights, powers or duties of the School or apply in relation to a person unless – a) his appointment is made, or his contract of employment is entered into, on or after 20 November 1987; or b) he is promoted o n or after that date. (2) For the purposes of this paragraph in relation to a person, a reference to an appointment made or a contract entered into on or after 20th November 1987 or to promotion on or after that date shall be construed in accordance with subsections (3) to (6) of section 204 of the Education Reform Act 1988. The Appropriate Body 10. 7 (1) The Standing Committee shall be the appropriate body for the purposes of this Part. (2) This paragraph applies where the appropriate body has decided that it is desirable that there should be a reduction in the academic staff – a) of the School as a whole; or b) of any department or other similar area of the School by way of redundancy. 11. (1) Where the appropriate body has reached a decision under paragraph 10 (2) it shall appoint a Redundancy Committee to be constituted in accordance with sub -paragraph (3) of this paragraph to give effect to its decision by such date as it may specify and for that purpose a) to select and recommend the requisite members of the academic staff for dismissal by reason of redundancy; and b) to report their recommendations to the appropriate body. BYELAW 2 The Redundancy Committee set up under paragraph 11.1 of the Academic Annex shall, having formulated firm recommendations for dismissal by reason of redundancy under paragraph 11.2, disclose to the President of the Local Association of the A UT in writing: a) the reasons for the proposed redundancy; b) the numbers and descriptions of employees whom it is proposing to dismiss; c) the total number of employees of any such description employed in the School; d) the proposed method of selection and how it shall be applied in relation to the School\\'s organisational structure; e) the proposed method of carrying out the dismissals; f) the formula for determining redundancy pay agreed by the Standing Committee other than statutory redundancy pay; g) any retention of School benefits; 8 h) whether a redundant employee may leave during the notice period or postpone the date of expiry of notice without the individual losing any entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment; i) proposed arrangements for assistance with job seeking and for time off with pay to seek alternative work or for retraining. The consultation period with the Local Associat ion of the AUT shall commence as soon as possible and shall be in accordance with the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 as amended by the Trade Unions Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. Whenever possible the consultation shall t ake place over a longer period than the minimum provided for in this legislation. Consultation with the Local Association of the AUT shall include consultation about ways of avoiding the dismissal, reducing the number of employees to be dismissed and mitig ating the consequences of the dismissals and shall be undertaken with a view to reaching agreement with the AUT. BYELAW 3 In formulating recommendations for redundancy under paragraph 11 (1) (a) of the Academic Annex, the Redundancy Committee shall in part icular take account of the following general factors in selecting potential candidates for redundancy: a) skills, qualifications, experience and aptitudes; b) period of service; c) standard of work performance; d) potential adaptability for alternative wor k. As stated in Byelaw 1, these criteria shall be applied in as objective, fair, consistent and non - discriminatory a manner as possible. (2) The appropriate body shall either approve any selection recommendation made under sub- paragraph (1), or shall remit it to the Redundancy Committee for further consideration in accordance with its further directions. (3) A Redundancy Committee appointed by the appropriate body shall comprise: - a) a Chairman; and b) two members of the Standing Committee, not being person s employed by the School; and c) two members of the academic staff nominated by the Academic Board. 9 BYELAW 4 The two Academic Board representatives to be appointed to the Redundancy Committee under Regulation 11 (3) (c) shall be selected by lot from a pane l of ten representatives nominated annually for this purpose by the Board. The lot shall be drawn by the Vice -Chairman of the Academic Board, and the results reported to the Standing Committee. The composition of the Academic Board Panel shall have due consideration to the School\\'s commitments to Equal Opportunities. The Standing Committee members shall be nominated by the Chairman of the Court or his deputy. Notices of intended dismissal 12. (1) Where the appropriate body has approved a selection recommend ation made under paragraph 11 (l) it may authorise an officer of the School as its delegate to dismiss any member of the academic staff so selected. (2) Each member of the academic staff selected shall be given separate notice of the selection approved by the appropriate body. BYELAW 5 Where selection for redundancy has been confirmed under Regulation 12(l), members selected shall in the written notice of the selection sent under Regulation 12(2) also be informed of the following matters additional to those specified in Regulation 12(3):- a) the option of payment in lieu of notice in accordance with contractual entitlements; b) that the School shall make every effort to seek alternative employment in the School for them and shall take steps to inform them of any available vacancies; c) that the School shall also endeavour to assist members for whom alternative employment cannot be found in the School to find outside employment. Individual counselling and the provision of appropriate supporting resources shall also be made available to members made compulsorily redundant. d) the entitlements they have to compensation in accordance with the statutory redundancy payments scheme and the method of calculation of their redundancy pay; e) that subject to the working requirements of their Department/ Institute/ Centre/ Service, they shall be given permission to take time off work during their notice period to look for work or seek retraining opportunities in accordance with current legislation, following consultation w ith their Convener of Department/ Head of Institute/ Centre/ Service; (3) Each separate notice shall sufficiently identify the circumstances which have satisfied the 10 appropriate body that the intended dismissal is reasonable and in particular shall include - a) a summary of the action taken by the appropriate body under this Part; b) an account of the selection processes used by the Redundancy Committee; c) a reference to the rights of the person notified to appeal against the notice and to the time within which any such appeal is to be lodged under Part V (Appeals); and d) a statement as to when the intended dismissal is to take effect. Part III - Disciplinary and Dismissals and Removal from Office Disciplinary Procedures 13. (1) Minor faults shall be dealt with informally. BYELAW 1 The following procedure shall be followed in dealing with minor faults under paragraph 13.1 of the Academic Annex: i. Minor breaches of discipline may result in an informal oral warning being given by the Convener, Head of Instit ute/ Research Centre or immediate reporting officer of the member of staff. A note of the content of this warning shall be kept by the Convener/ Head of Institute/ Research Centre/ Head of Service. ii. It is expected that in most cases an informal oral war ning shall quickly resolve most difficulties without the necessity of recourse to the formal procedures in paragraphs 13 (2) to 20 of the Academic Annex. iii. Examples of the type of conduct which may initially be dealt with informally are unexplained lateness or absence. (2) Where the matter is more serious but falls short of constituting possible good cause for dismissal the following procedure shall be used: - BYELAW 2 The formal procedure set out in paragraph 13 (2) shall also be used when an employ ee, having received 11 an appropriate informal warning, fails to improve and maintain that improvement with regard to conduct or job performance. Stage 1 - Oral Warning If conduct or performance does not meet acceptable standards the member of the academic staff will normally be given a formal ORAL WARNING. The member will be advised of the reason for the warning, that it is the first stage of the disciplinary procedure and of the right of appeal under this paragraph. A brief note of the oral warning will be k ept but it will be spent after twelve months, subject to satisfactory conduct and performance. Stage 2 - Written Warning If the offence is a serious one, or if a further offence occurs, a WRITTEN WARNING will be given to the member of the academic staff by the Convenor or Head of the Institute, Research Centre or Service concerned. This will give details of the complaint, the improvement required and the timescale. It will warn that a complaint may be made to the School Secretary seeking the institution of charges to be heard by a Tribunal appointed under paragraph 16 if there is no satisfactory improvement and will advise of the right of appeal under this paragraph. A copy of this written warning will be kept by the Convener or Head of the Institute, Resear ch Centre or Service concerned but it will be disregarded for disciplinary purposes after two years subject to satisfactory conduct and performance. BYELAW 3 i. The formal procedure in stage 2 in paragraph 13 (2) shall be invoked by the Convener of Departm ent, Head of Institute/ Research Centre or immediate reporting officer of the member of staff, who shall make it clear in writing to the member that the formal procedure is being followed, and the complaints to be considered. ii. Any Convener, Head of Institute/ Research Centre or immediate reporting officer proposing to invoke the formal procedures shall first consult Personnel Services. iii. Where an accredited trade union representative may be liable to disciplinary action, Personnel Services should be informed immediately so that contact may be made with a full -time trade union official. iv. In any case, where the School knows that a member of staff is a member of the LSE Association of the AUT, the Branch President shall be told by the School that a complaint has been lodged together with the nature of the complaint. Where the member of staff who is subject of a complaint is not to the knowledge of the School an A UT member, the Branch President shall be told that a complaint has been lodged against a colleague without the member concerned 12 being named, together with the nature of the complaint. v. When an allegation of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance failing short of possible good cause for dismissal arises, an investigation shall be conduct ed by the Convener of Department, Head of Institute/ Research Centre, immediate reporting officer or their nominated representative, unless they are personally involved in any incident of alleged misconduct. A member of the Staffing Office shall also be involved in the investigation. 7he investigation shall include the questioning of witnesses and the employee concerned, who may be accompanied by a representative of the Local AUT or some other person of the employee\\'s choice. vi. If the Convener, Head of In stitute/ Research Centre is personally involved in the alleged misconduct, the investigation shall be conducted by a nominee of the Director, who shall be of equivalent status to the Convener Head of Institute/ Research Centre or immediate reporting office r. vii. A member may be suspended on full pay if, in the view of the Convener, Head of Institute/ Research Centre or immediate reporting officer or their nominated representative or nominee of the Director, that would assist the investigation. A suspension on full pay shall not normally exceed three working days, but may be longer if that is considered necessary to assist the investigation. In every case, the member shall be informed in writing of the reason (s) for the suspension and the duration of it. viii. If following investigation, it is found that disciplinary action may be justified, a formal disciplinary hearing shall be arranged by Personnel Services, normally within five working days of the end of the investigations. 7he employee shall be informed in writing of the date, time and place of the hearing, and of the right to be accompanied by a representative of the Local AUT or another person of their choice. ix. The Disciplinary Panel shall normally comprise the Convener, Head of Institute/ Research Centre or immediate reporting officer, a further member of management if that is considered appropriate, and a member of the Staffing Officer who shall act as an advisor to the Panel. Where the Convener, Head of Institute/ Research Centre or immediate repo rting officer is personally involved the Director shall make arrangements for his nominee(s) to be present to consider the evidence presented by the Convener/Head of Institute/ Research Centre or immediate reporting officer, and the employee, together with a member of the Staffing Office. x. The employee shall have the right to call witnesses to the hearing, and shall be afforded every opportunity at the hearing to state the member\\'s case before a determination on the case is made. xi. There shall be provis ion for the adjournment of disciplinary hearings if any matter is raised which requires further checking or investigation before a decision as to penalty is taken. xii. Following consideration of the evidence, the Convener, Head of Institute/ Research Cent re, 13 immediate reporting officer or Director\\'s nominee shall inform the member in writing within five working days of the hearing of the nature of the disciplinary action to be taken under paragraph 13(2). BYELAW 4 The following byelaw elaborates on the pro visions of paragraph 13 (2) stage 2 regarding the issue of written disciplinary warnings: i. At the discretion of the Disciplinary Panel and depending on the seriousness of the offence, a written warning may be imposed under Stage 2 without art oral warnin g (Stage 1) having previously been given. ii. At the discretion of the Disciplinary Panel a first written warning may be imposed as an intermediate stage between an oral warning and a final written warning. A first written warning shall normally be kept on the member\\'s personal file in the Staffing Office for twelve months, after which time it shall be expunged, subject to satisfactory conduct and performance. iii. Except in cases of gross misconduct which shall be dealt with under paragraphs 14 -20, there shall not normally be dismissal for a first offence. BYELAW 5 This byelaw relates to the arrangements for the retention of written warnings issued under paragraph 13(2) stage 2. A copy of a final written warning shall also be kept on the individual\\'s person al file in the Staffing Office for two years. Stage 3 - Appeals A member of the academic staff who wishes to appeal against a disciplinary warning shall inform the School Secretary within two weeks. The Vice -Chairman of the Appointments Committee shall hear all such appeals and his decision shall be final. BYELAW 6 i. On receipt of a notification of appeal against a disciplinary warning under paragraph 13(2), the Secretary shall arrange for an appeal to be heard under \"Stage 3 \" of the procedure within ten working days, or as soon as is reasonably practicable. ii. The Vice -Chairman of the Appointments Committee shall hear the appeal with a member of Personnel Services in attendance to advise on procedure. The appellant shall have the right to be 14 accompan ied by a representative of the Local AUT, or by another person of the appellant\\'s choice, to introduce new evidence and to call witnesses to the appeal hearing as appropriate at the discretion of the Vice -Chairman of the Appointments Committee. 7he Vice- Chairman may, if it appears to him necessary to assist in the determination of the appeal, also call the Converter, Head of Research Centre/ Institute, immediate line manager, or Director\\'s nominee, who imposed the disciplinary penalty to attend the hearing as a witness. iii. There shall be provision for adjournments of the hearing if the Vice -Chairman considers it necessary. iv. The decision of the Vice -Chairman on the appeal shall be conveyed to the appellant in writing within three working days of the appe al hearing, with a copy, if applicable, to his trades union representative. There shall be no further right of appeal. Preliminary examination of serious disciplinary matters 14. (1) If there has been no satisfactory improvement following a written warning given under Stage 2 of the procedure in paragraph 13, or in any other case where it is alleged that conduct or performance may constitute good cause for dismissal or removal from office, a complaint seeking the institution of charges to be heard by the Tr ibunal appointed under paragraph 16 may be made to the School Secretary who shall bring it to the attention of the Director. BYELAW 7 i. This byelaw sets out the arrangements for consideration of a complaint under the provisions of paragraph 14(l) of the \" Academic Annex\". It is expected that the complaint to the School Secretary shall be made by the Convener, Head of Centre/ institute or immediate reporting officer. If the complaint is against the School Secretary, it shall be lodged directly with the Director. The School Secretary shall notify the member of staff that a formal complaint has been lodged under this part of the disciplinary procedure within five working days of the receipt of the complaint and advise the member of the provisions of the procedu re. ii. If the employee is known to be a member of the Local Association of the AUT, the School Secretary shall inform the Branch Secretary that a complaint has been made and shall be considered under the good cause provisions of the Academic Annex procedure. iii. The Director shall normally seek to conclude his investigations into the complaint within twenty -eight days of the receipt of the complaint, and shall notify his decision as to future action in writing to the member within five working days of the conclusion of the investigations. 15 iv. The Director shall inform the employee in writing of his determination of the complaint, following the receipt of comments (if any) from the member within fourteen days of the receipt of comments or upon the expiry of the twenty -eight days provided for the submission of comments under paragraph 14(7). When the employee is a member of the Local Association of the AUT, the Director shall send a copy of his letter to the Branch President. (2) To enable the Director to deal fairly with any complaint brought to his attention under sub - paragraph (1) he shall institute such investigations or enquiries (if any) as appear to him to be necessary. (3) If it appears to the Director that a complaint brought to his attention under s ub-paragraph (1) relates to conduct or performance which does not meet acceptable standards but for which no written warning has been given under paragraph 13 or which relates to a particular alleged infringement of rules, regulations or byelaws for which a standard penalty is normally imposed in the School or within the department or other relevant area, or is trivial or invalid he may dismiss it summarily, or decide not to proceed further under this Part. (4) If the Director does not dispose of a complain t under sub - paragraph (3) he shall treat the complaint as disclosing a sufficient reason for proceeding further under this Part and, if he sees fit, he may suspend the member on full pay pending a final decision. (5) Where the Director proceeds further un der this Part he shall write to the member of the academic staff concerned inviting comment in writing. (6) As soon as may be following receipt of the comments (if any) the Director shall consider the matter in the light of all the material then available and may - a) dismiss it himself; or b) refer it for consideration under paragraph 13; or c) deal with it informally himself if it appears to the Director appropriate to do so and if the member of the academic staff agrees in writing that the matter should be dealt with in that way; or d) direct the School Secretary to prefer a charge or charges to be considered by a Tribunal to be appointed under paragraph 16. (7) If no comment is received within twenty -eight days the Director may proceed as aforesaid as if the member concerned had denied the substance and validity of the alleged case in its entirely. Institution of Charges 16 15. (1) In any case where the Director has directed that a charge or charges be preferred under paragraph 14(6)(d), he shall request the Standing Committee to appoint a Tribunal under paragraph 16 to hear the charge or charges and to determine whether the conduct or performance of the member of the academic staff concerned constitutes good cause for dismissal or otherwise constitutes a serious complaint relating to the member\\'s appointment or employment. (2) Where the Standing Committee has been requested to appoint a Tribunal under paragraph 16 the School Secretary or, if he is unable to act, another officer appointed by the Director shall take charge of the proceedings. (3) The officer in charge of the proceedings shall formulate, or arrange for the formulation of, the charge or charges and shall present, or arrange for the presentation of, the charge or charges before the Tribunal.

(5) If the Director does not reject the complaint under subparagraph (3) or if he does not defer action upon it under subparagraph (4) he shall decide whether it would b e appropriate, having regard to the interests of justice and fairness, for him to seek to dispose of it informally.

       "  'text': \"1 Introduction The School is committed to the promotion of equality of opportunity for all employees. It works towards positively supporting employees who are working carers and has attained a reputation as a top employer for working families. The School recognises that carers' needs can be different from those with childcare responsibilities and that the circumstances and stages of caring are diverse in nature. This policy demonstrates a commitment on the part of the School to help carers combine work with the care of o thers. This policy uses the following definition of a carer: a person of any age who provides unpaid support to family or friends who could not manage without this help. This could be caring for a relative, partner or friend who is older, ill, frail, disab led and/or has mental health or substance misuse issues. The type of support offered by carers is wide ranging and may include: • emotional support via regular telephone calls, emails and/or visits • help with financial matters or paperwork • help with personal care • help with household tasks • help with mobility Policy on the Support for Carers (Those who provide unpaid support to family or friends who are older, disabled or seriously ill) Operational 2 • managing medication The stages of caring can be very different depending on the circumstances. A person may acquire caring responsibilities suddenly, they may need to provide intermittent care or they may need to increase their care on an incremental basis. An organisational approach to supporting carers in the workplace must necessarily be flexible as a result. Policy aims The School seeks to sustain a strong track record as a diverse, fair and flexible employer that attracts and retains high calibre talent, and supports the career progression of all staff during their employment by the School. Whilst it is recognised that employees may choose not to disclose their caring responsibilities to others at work, the School aims to provide an environment where employees who do wish to disclose their caring responsibilities feel comfortable doing so. It is also recognised that carers might not identify themselves under the term 'carer' because they may take it for granted that they should offer physical or emotional support to people they care about. Carers of dependents who live elsewhere may also not recognise that their support means that they are carers. This policy seeks to outline the sup port available to all staff with such personal responsibilities outside of work, irrespective of whether they wish to identify themselves as a ‘carer’. The purpose of the policy is to help employees with caring responsibilities and to provide support that strengthens both personal and work relationships. Policy principles Legislative Framework It is useful to note a number of statutory provisions that that an organisation is required to consider in supporting carers, whilst recognising that fostering an e mpathetic organisational culture is about more than meeting statutory requirements: 1. Changes brought in by the Children and Families Act 2014 mean that all employees who have at least 26 weeks’ continuous service can make a request to work flexibly. The legislation states that applications should be dealt within a reasonable manner. Guidance on this is contained in the statutory “ Acas Code of Practice on handling in a reasonable manner requests to work flexibly ”1. Once an employee has submitted a valid statutory request for fl exible working, employers must deal with the request within a three -month time limit. The School’s “Flexible Working”2 webpages provide further information. 1 Available from www.acas.org.uk 2 See HR A -Z on intranet 3 2. Under s.57A of the Employment Rights Act 1996, employees are entitled to a reasonable amount of unpaid time off to deal with emergency situations involving their dependents. The School’s guidance on “time off for emergencies involving a dependant”3 provides further information. 3. The Equality Act 2010 prohibits direct discrimination, which is less fav ourable treatment because of a protected characteristic. This also extends to “discrimination by association”, which means that employees who care for a disabled or elderly person are protected against less favourable treatment because of their association with that person. For example, if an employee is not selected for a job because of their caring responsibilities for a disabled partner, this would amount to discrimination because of the protected characteristic of disability. The Act also protects emplo yees from harassment, which is unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating the victim's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for him or her. This means that employees who care for a disabled or elderly person are protected against harassment because of their association with that person. Support through policies and provisions 4. Much of the support for carers is detailed in the School’s other policies, procedures and guidance as follows: • Flexible Working, which includes flexitime, reduced hours, part -time working, compressed hours and unpaid leave to allow for care for others; • the School’s guidance on “staff support leave”, including “time off for emergencies involving a dependant”; • the School’s guidance on Compassionate Leave, which includes paid time for when a close relative is terminally ill or when, in the absence of other nursing arrangements, an employee is responsible for care. 5. Both managers and staff should approach both temporary and permanent solutions with an open and creative mind, being willing to consider new and alternative options that balance both the individual’s needs and those operational requirements that must also be considered. Networks, information and advice 6. It is often easier for employees to talk about childcare responsibilities than to discuss caring responsibilities. Employees are not requir ed to disclose to their line manager that they are caring for someone, but are encouraged to do so. This will help the line manager to provide appropriate support to the employee. Line managers should encourage employees to talk about their caring responsi bilities with them whilst respecting the employee's confidentiality concerning this information. However, whilst some staff may want to talk about their caring responsibilities beyond the essential details, others will wish to keep the division between wor k and home more distinct. Line managers are encouraged to recognise that different individuals will be comfortable with differing levels of disclosure and will have varying needs in relation to both practical and emotional support. 7. Employees who do not wi sh to disclose their caring responsibilities to their line manager are encouraged to approach their HR Partner and/or the School’s developing Carers’ Network, which is an informal private group of employees who have identified themselves as a carer. Its 3 See HR A -Z on intranet 4 purpose is to provide practical peer -to-peer support and information and support, from internal and external sources. 8. The School also subscribes to the national Employers for Carers network, established by Carers UK, which provides information directly to staff about balancing work and caring for dependents. The Employers for Carers site can be accessed by registering here www.employersforcarers.org and quote the Schools membership number #EFC1190 when registering. 9. Many charities, local authorities and community groups will have online and face -to-face support for carers, enabling individuals to seek advice and make connections with others in similar circumstances. Some of the main charities that provide national support to carers, or who work with carers relating to specific issues, are: • Carers UK: http://www.carersuk.org/ • Carers Trust: https://www.carers.org/ • Age UK: http://www.ageuk.org.uk/ • Mind: http://www.mind.org.uk/ • Alzheimer’s Society: https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/ • Macmillan Cancer Support: http://www.macmillan.org.uk/ This is by no means exhaustive. Facebook groups, online message boards and other social media networks are increasingly ways in which support and advice ca n be found. 10. Employees may also find it helpful to access the confidential Staff Counselling Service for support. 5 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 123 00/00/00 00/00/00 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 123 00/00/00 abc abc 123 00/00/00 abc abc Links Reference Link 123 abc 123 abc Contacts Position Name Email Notes abc abc abc@lse.ac.uk abc Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

How is my Annual Leave calculated? The annual leave entitlement at the School is made up of 25 days for holiday, 8 bank holidays and 8 closure days which equates to a total of 41 days per annum. Calculations are based on this figure and will be pro -rated according to an employee’s individual working hours and terms and conditions of employment. 2. I am on a f ixed term contract, what happens with my 41-day entitlement? The system will refer to your projected end date and will provide the exact entitlement for the period of your employment. Should this date be extended, the figure will be recalculated to ensure you receive the correct amount. 3. Why is my leave calculated in hours? If you are Part Time or have compacted Full Time working arrangements, your annual leave gets calculated into hours according to your FTE and based on your specific working pattern e.g. what days you work and how many hours you work on those days. Part Time employees or Full Time employees with a compacted arrangement may have shorter and/or longer working days against the standard 7 hours and so the deduction of leave needs to be appropriate. 4. My entitlement does not look right, who can I speak to? In the first instance check with your HR administrato r. Your allocated Administrator can be found here Section 2: Bookings, Cancellations and Amendments 1. How do I book annual leave in MyView? A series o f methods are available. Please refer to the guidance manual here 2. What happens with bank holidays and closure days? The School’s holiday entitlement is ma de up to 25 days’ annual leave, 8 bank holidays and 8 closure days (ie.41 days in total). As such, all staff have been allocated a 41-day entitlement and you will, therefore, need to book off all bank holidays and closure days. HR will issue all relevant dates at the start of the calendar year and these can also be found here This will ensure that holiday entitlement is applied fairly to all staff regardless of their working pattern and will replace the use of the Schools annual leave calculator. Manager s and employees will therefore be able to have the figures at their fingertips should an employee leave the School, as the system calculates this automatically based on an employee’s last day. Furthermore, the system wil l be able to calculate the correct entitlement, depending on when the start date is in the year, pro -rata to 41 days. 3. I am a part -time member of staff, how will the system work for me? You will use the system in exactly the same way as full -time staff (as explained above). You will only n eed to book the days off for bank holidays and closure days that fall within your normal working pattern therefore please ensure this is correct and up to date. Your leave will also be recorded in hours and not days. 4. How can I cancel my annual leave? You will need to speak to your manager to cancel your annual leave who will be able to cancel this for you. This is to prevent leave being cancelled in error by employees. 5. I need to make an amendment to my annual leave request; how do I do this? You can modify your annual leave requests. This will go through the same authorisation chain as the original request. To do so, please refer to the guidance manual here 4 Section 3: Changes in circumstances 1. What happens if I start or leave part way through the year? The system is designed to calculate the 41-day entitlement based on an employee’s start date and/or end date on a weekly basis. 2. What happens if my working hours change (increase or decrease)? If your working hours increase or decrease a contract variation form will be submitted to HR to ensure that your record (and salary) are correct. Upon approval of this change request your annual leave entitlemen t will be recalculated accordingly. If your working terms change, for example, from Full Time to Part Time, the unit rate for which you will book your annual leave will change from days to hours. 3. What happens if I go on Maternity leave? Whilst on maternit y leave your entitlement will continue to accrue based on 41 days, pro -rated if Part Time. Any annual leave taken before maternity leave begins should be booked in the normal way. Your record will be amended before your return following any arrangements agreed with your line manager. 4. What happens when I am on l ong term sick? Whilst on sick leave your entitlement will continue to accrue based on 41 days, pro -rated if Part Time. 5. What happens if my working pattern changes? Working patterns are more relevant to Part Time or Full Time compacted employees and it is t herefore important to keep your working pattern up to date to ensure the correct amount of leave is deducted. It will also mean you w ill not have to keep amending it when requesting leave. To request permanent changes to your working pattern please complet e the eform within MyView called Request to amend working pattern. This will require authorisation from your line manager. 6. What carry over am I allowed and how does it work? Up to five days' leave may be carried over from one year to the next (pro rata fo r part -time staff). Agreement to carry over more than this is usually given only when there are strong personal reasons or when school business has prevented staff from taking leave. 7. How does my holiday get approved? Upon submission of your annual leave r equest your manager will receive notification via e -mail but the request will also be visible on their MyView dashboard. Your line manager will need to approve or reject your request; you will be notified via e -mail of the outcome. Section 4: Delegations 1. What is a delegation? A delegation within MyView allows you to delegate approvals or responsibilities to a member of your team either permanently or for a period. Examples of these can be annual leave requests. 2. Who can I delegate to? At present, you can only delegate to those that are below you in the management hierarchy. This could be a Deputy, Office Manager, PA or any other member of staff that reports directly to them. 3. I want to delegate responsibility of authorising annual leave requests to another team member, how do I do it? Please check the appropriate guidance material here. Delegations need to be set up by the individual who is delegat ing, please remember access to MyView is via your LSE credentials and therefore these should never be shared. 5 4. What happens if the Head of Department is your line manager? Where your line manager is a Head of Department they will receive notifications of w hen annual leave is requested, to approve or decline through the system. This system will allow your Head of Department to delegate the responsibility of approving and declining annual leave, to their Deputy, an Office Manager, PA or any other member of st aff that reports directly to them.

       "  'text': '1 Purpose of the Policy The purpose of the policy is to support new employees from overseas (usually academic appointments) during their first month\\'s employment at the School by guaranteeing their financi al eligibility for a School sponsored Tier 2 visa. The terms of the policy are drafted to help ensure that the School is financially protected when a salary advance is requested in these circumstances. The Policy addresses a specific issue resulting fro m the recent changes to the immigration system, and is not intended to provide for salary advances in any other circumstances, or to amend existing School policies. A separate project is underway to review the relocation and housing assistance provided b y the School to new employees. Tier 2 Tier 2 applicants must score a minimum of 50 points under the UKVI system in order to apply for a Tier 2 visa. In addition a key requirement of Tier 2 is that an individual must demonstrate that they have had \"the Mi nimum Sum\" (currently £945 plus additional savings of £630 for each accompanying dependant*), in their bank account for a continuous 90 -day period prior to submitting the application. *This figure may vary; it will be the Minimum Sum required by the UKVI at the date the application is granted. The balance of the account must not drop below the Minimum Sum, even for one day, or UKVI will reject the application as not meeting the maintenance requirement. Some individuals, for example, those who have not yet completed, or have recently completed, their PhDs may therefore not be able to demonstrate that they have access to this funding. There is a provision in the Points Based Immigration System for A -rated sponsors (the School is A - rated) to provide a writte n undertaking that, should it become necessary, the sponsor will maintain and accommodate the migrant until the end of the first month of employment. The provision states Advance Payments Policy for Tier 2 Visa Applicants Operational 2 that the sponsor may limit the amount of the undertaking, but that limit should not b e less than the Minimum Sum. Numbers of Employees requiring support for Tier 2 Visa Applications We estimate that approximately 40 new joiners per year will need to obtain a Tier 2 visa before commencing employment with the School, although not all Tier 2 applicants will require the School to guarantee their maintenance and accommodation for the first month of employment. HR will maintain a record of the numbers of Tier 2 applicants requiring the maintenance guarantee, and those who then go onto apply for the salary advance provided by the maintenance guarantee, in order to review this policy annually. Process for Offering the Maintenance Guarantee The School will issue a supplementary letter (Appendix 1) to offer a maintenance guarantee to new employee s for Tier 2 visas who are unable to demonstrate the Minimum Sum in their bank account for a continuous 90 -day period prior to the submission of the visa application. The maintenance guarantee will also cover the employee\\'s accompanying dependants - define d as the husband, wife, civil partner or unmarried or same -sex partner of the employee, and their children under 18 years old. The size of the potential advance will be limited to the UKVI\\'s Minimum Sum requirement at the date the letter is issued, so that it is not regarded as benefit -in-kind, (which may have tax implications for the individual and the School) and to minimise the School\\'s risk in making a salary advance to a new employee. Process for Approving and Administering Advance Payments Shoul d the new employee decide to apply for a salary advance under the terms of the supplementary letter, they must make a written request to the Head of Payroll, stating: • What attempts they have already made to cover their first month\\'s maintenance and accomm odation for example: relying on savings in a number of accounts; obtaining a loan; sale of assets; relying on credit cards; etc. and why these attempts have been unsuccessful. • How the employee has calculated the level of salary advance they seek and sub mitting appropriate documentation with the request e.g. recent bank statements; proof of accommodation costs; etc. • The name, date of birth, and relationship to the employee, of each accompanying dependant, and submitting a photocopy of the picture page of the passport for each accompanying dependant. 3 These requests will be stored on the employee\\'s personal file and processed by Payroll. Once the Head of Payroll is satisfied by the new employee\\'s application for the salary advance, Payroll will write to th e new employee to agree the salary advance, and the repayment arrangement. The salary advance will be paid to the employee on their first day of employment with the School, or as soon as possible thereafter. The payment cannot be made until the employee h as commenced employment with the School. It will be repaid in monthly instalments direct from salary up to a maximum of six months, as agreed in writing with the individual. No additional payments will be made to the individual, including but not limite d to, accommodation deposit, rent, travelling expenses (including travel to the UK) and food. It is expected that all necessary accommodation and associated living expenses will be paid for by the salary advance. There will be no additional payments made to support any dependants of the individual. Employees will be expected to maintain and accommodate any dependants using the salary advance. Written by: Human Resources and Payroll Agreed by: Director of Finance Director of Human Resources 4 Appendix 1 – Supplementary Letter Dear [ ] I write further to your appointment letter dated [ ] which confirms the terms of your appointment with the London School of Economics. It is expected that you will make every reasonable effort to support yourself and any dependants on arrival in the United Kingdom. However, in order to enable you to meet the maintenance requirements of the Home Office\\'s Tier 2 Visa Category, it is agreed that the School will help maintain and accommodate you during the first month o f your employment by advancing to you up to a maximum up to a limit of [£945 plus £630*] per accompanying dependant, on your first day of employment with the School, or as soon as possible thereafter. Accompanying dependants are defined as your husband, wi fe, civil partner or unmarried or same -sex partner, and your children under 18 years old. The application for the salary advance should be in writing and addressed to the Head of Payroll, Finance Division, LRB502 Lionel Robbins Building, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE or emailed to fin.div.payroll@lse.ac.uk and indicate the size of the salary advance you are seeking, how you have justified this sum and what other options you have pursued to cover your ma intenance and accommodation during your first month in the UK. In the event that you apply and are granted a salary advance to help maintain and accommodate you during your first month of employment, this advance will be repaid in equal instalments as ded uctions from future salary payments over a period of not more than 6 months. The exact period over which this advance will be deducted, and the monthly instalments, shall be agreed and confirmed in writing on commencement of your employment. In the event that you leave your employment with the School prior to repayment of any salary advance, the School will deduct the amount advanced from any monies due to you and seek to recover any outstanding balance. *This figure may vary; it will be the Minimum Sum r equired by the UKVI at the date the letter is issued. 5 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start Version history Version Date Approved by Notes Links Reference Link Contacts Position Name Email Notes Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': '1 1. Introduction and Purpose of Policy 1.1. The School’s policy is to recruit by open selection, unless there is an objective justification for not advertising. Advertising a role does not in any way preclude Departments from also approaching individual candidates deemed suitable for the role, and inviting them to submit a formal application in response to the published advertisement. 1.2. In exceptional cases, the School may be prepared to consider the appointment of staff via a single nomination route. To establish such a case, the recruiting department will be expected to submit a case to support the single n omination request, stating clearly why the post cannot/should not be advertised and referring to supporting evidence. 1.3. It should be noted that non -UK nationals require a visa to work in the UK; however due to the UK’s immigration policy, the School is norm ally unable to sponsor an individual without having conducted a full and open recruitment campaign. There are some exceptions to this, for example in cases where an individual has been awarded a research grant and is brining it with them to the School. H owever, the normal route for those who are being recruited via the Single Nomination Procedure and need a visa is the Global Talent Visa. More information about the Global Talent Visa can be found on the HR website. 1.4. This Policy is an ancillary document to the Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedure (Academic, Research and Teaching Appointments) and provides an overview of the School’s approach to appointments of staff by single nomination. This Policy should be read in conjunction with the Single Nomination Procedure (Academic, Research, Te aching & Professionally Qualified Faculty Appointments). 2 Policy Scope 2.1 The following are examples of where a Department, Centre or Institute may consider submitting a single nomination request: • Where an individual is named on a research grant and/or is bringing a research grant with them to the School; • Where an individual has produced significant and outstanding work on a research Single Nomination Policy and Procedure Academ ic, Research, Teaching & Professionally Qualified Faculty Appointments Academic 2 proposal, which has resulted in the award of a research grant at L SE, and the recruiting department can show the individual’s expertise is essential for the continuation of the project; • Where a recruiting department has advertised the vacancy prior to the single nomination request and been unsuccessful in attracting suit ably qualified candidates; • Where a high -profile figure approaches the School with a view to join the staff and would bring indisputable international reputation and credibility. 2.2 This policy applies to roles at the following levels: Post Approved by Prof essor President and Vice Chancellor or Vice President and Pro -Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) Professorial Research Fellow Professorial Lecturer Professor in Practice Associate Professor Vice President and Pro -Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) Associate Professorial Research Fellow Associate Professorial Lecturer Senior Policy Fellow Distinguished Policy Fellow Assistant Professor Assistant Professorial Research Fellow Assistant Professorial Lecturer Senior Lecturer in Practice Policy Fellow Vice -Chair of the Appointments Committee (VCAC) Research Fellow Course Tutor Policy Officer Research Officer LSE Fellow 2.3 ‘Named Researchers’ can be appointed under this Policy and Procedure. ‘Named Researchers’ are individuals who have applied to a research body as Principal Investigator and been awarded funding to conduct a research project to be hosted by the LSE. This process is based on the principle that LSE would not have a role for the individual if it was not for the funding that they are bringing to the School; therefore, a genuine ‘Named Researcher’ is led by the individual and not by the LSE. In cases where a resea rcher is included on an application submitted by a member of LSE staff and their CV provided as part of the proposal, the bid is led by the LSE rather than the researcher. ‘Named Researchers’ include schemes such as The Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow ships, Marie Sklodowska - Curie Fellowships, British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowships and ESRC Future Research Leaders. 2.4 Single nomination requests for Assistant Professor and LSE Fellow candidates should only be sought in very exceptional circumstances. 3 Policy Aims 3.1 If the single nomination route is adopted, the School will endeavour to match the rigour of the standard recruitment procedures, in order to ensure equality and the selection of the best possible candidate. 3 3.2 Single nomination candidates for As sistant Professor or Associate Professor roles should presently, or in due course, rank above the median of existing faculty quality of, respectively, Assistant Professors or Associate Professors in the Department. Candidates for Professorial appointment v ia single nomination must be truly outstanding and should thus presently or in due course rank within the top third of Professorial faculty quality. 3.3 All candidates should be considered fairly and consistently and decisions on a candidate’s suitability for a post are based on how they meet the person specification for the post. Selection decisions should be explicitly based upon evidence, though the evidence required may differ according to the type of role; CVs, covering letters, writing samples and references are routine. 4 Policy Principles 4.1 The same principles apply as in the Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedure (Academic, Research and Teaching Appointments) document. 4.2 Departments/Centres/Institutes should ensure that information regarding the single nominated candidate is kept confidential throughout the consideration process. 5 Roles and Responsibilities 5.1 The same roles and responsibilities apply as in the Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedure • (Academic, Research and T eaching Appointments) document, with the exception of: • As roles are not advertised, HR do not have responsibility for ensuring posts meet the Resident Labour Market Test (RLMT). • Recruiting managers need only ensure that funding is in place from the Finance/Research Division prior to a single nomination request being made (i.e. combined first and second fund check). 4 Single Nomination Procedure Academic, Research, Teaching & Professionally Qualified Faculty Appointments 1 Introduction and Purpose of Procedure 1.1 This Procedure is an ancillary document to the Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedure (Academic, Research and Teaching Appointments) and provides an overview of the School’s approach to appointments of staff by single nomination. This Pr ocedure should be read in conjunction with the Single Nomination Policy (Academic, Research, Teaching & Professionally Qualified Faculty Appointments). 2 Making a single nomination request 2.1 The Head of Department/Centre Director/Institute Director is requ ired to submit a full request to hr.adviser@lse.ac.uk describing why the appointment should be made via the single nomination route. In cases of research staff, the single nomination request should be written by the Principal Investigator of the project an d endorsed by the Head of the Department. For research staff located in Research Centres or Institutes, the Centre/Institute Director should collaborate with the Head of Department for approval. 2.2 At this stage, the individual, if contacted at all, should b e clearly informed that the Department/ Centre/Institute is making a case which may or may not be accepted, but if not, the post will be advertised and the individual encouraged to formally apply for it. 2.3 The Department/Centre/Institute case should contain the following information: • A full explanation of the situation and why the appointment is necessary (in line with section 2.1 of the Single Nomination Policy); • A convincing explanation for why the post could not/should not be openly advertised, referring to supporting evidence; • A full account of the individual’s research and teaching experience, as applicable to the role, and their skills and qualifications, demonstrating how they meet and/or exceed the criteria for the role; • A full description of the expe cted contribution that the individual will make to the Department/ Centre/Institute and the School if appointed. 2.4 HR will liaise with either the President and Vice Chancellor, the Vice President and Pro -Vice Chancellor (Faculty Developm ent) or the VCAC, who will consider the recruiting Department/Centre/Institute’s initial single nomination request. 2.5 HR will confirm the decision to the Department/Centre/Institute. If permission is not granted, the Department/Centre/Institute will be provided with an explanation. HR will then work with the Department/Centre/Institute to formulate a targeted recruitment campaign to appoint to the role. 3 Progressing a single nomination 3.1 If the single nomination request is granted, then the following paperwork and information 5 should be submitted to hr.adviser@lse.ac.uk. Please note, the single nomination request will not be progressed until a ll of the documents/information has been received: • An up -to-date CV of the candidate. • Writing Samples: Examples of the candidate’s most significant published or unpublished work, such as journal articles, book chapters or books. For academic, New Research Staff Career (NRSC), and Research Fellow candidates, the nominating Department/Centre/Institute must comment in detail on the quality of each of the writings in the writing sample. • A written justification from the Head of Department/Centre Directo r/Institute Director for the proposed appointment, explaining why the candidate has the support of the department/centre/institute and in particular why they are suitably qualified for the post and capable of filling it. In the case of faculty appointments, the statement should state how the candidate ranks relative to existing faculty quality. It should also explain how equality and diversity considerations have been taken into account, given that the post has not been advertised. • A letter from the nominee explaining why they are interested in the post and how they have the skills/experience required to carry out the duties as listed in the Job Description • References: References should be solicited by the recruiting Department/Centre/Institute. HR can provide a template reference request email. All referees for academic and research appointments should be employed by a distinguished university, should be of international standing and active in research publication in the appropriate field. • The nomination of more than one referee from the same Department within the same institution will not normally be permitted; • Referees should not be from staff at the LSE. • The list of referees needs to be approved by, depending on the post, either the VCAC or the President and Vice Chancellor / Vice President and Pro -Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) before references are solicited. The Department/Centre/Institute should liaise directly with the VCAC or the Presid ent and Vice Chancellor / Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) for approval of the list of referees. For academic candidates and, NRSC and Research Fellow candidates, the expectation is that referees engage in detail with the quality of the candidates’ published work. Depending on the post, the VCAC or the President and Vice Chancellor / Vice President and Pro -Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) reserves the right to reject incoming references as insufficiently detailed and either to ask for additional references to be solicited or for the single nomination request to be rejected. • Job Description: in line with section 2.2 of the Recruitment and Selection Procedure (Academic, Research and Teaching Appointments). • Funding Approval: from the Finance/Research and Innovation Division, for the appointment. 6 3.2 Table of requirements Post Documents Required Written justification from HoD/RCD/ID for proposed appointment CV Letter from nominee to explain interest in post and how they meet criteria Writing Samples Department Ranking Equity & Diversity Statement References Job Description Funding Approval Panel Members Chair/Approver Professor Yes Yes Yes 4 Yes Yes 5: Referees should be confined to those of full Professorial status, including, where appropriate, scholars from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge who may not hold the title of Professor.

The same procedures as per sections 14 and 15 of the Recruitment and Selection Procedure (Academic, Research and Teaching Appointments) should then be followed. 3.5 Should the President and Vice Chancell or, Vice President and Pro -Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) or VCAC refuse a single nomination request, or the Selection Committee refuses a single nomination proposal, the Department/Centre/Institute will be required to advertise the vacancy by open competition if they wish to appoint to the role. 4 Progressing a Named Researcher For candidates that are named on a research grant (as specified in section 2.3), these may be processed via the named researcher route.

       "  'text': '1 Introduction As an employer, the School is committed to the development of its staff and to the recruitment of a diverse range of talented employees who can make a valuable contribution to the School. The School recognises that apprenticeships offer a unique opportu nity to develop new and existing staff, into current and future roles, with nationally recognised qualifications up to and above degree level. This policy, the School’s Apprenticeship Management Toolkit, and the government’s apprenticeship funding rules (whilst being liable to change), give guidance and support for staff and managers to use when considering the use of apprenticeships. Scope of Policy The School views an apprenticeship as a real job with an industry recognised and Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) approved structured study programme. Apprenticeships may be a framework or standard, with an end point assessment where applicable. The School views an apprentice as any LSE employee who is using levy funds to complete an apprenticeship, and who has an employment contract and in a role that gives them suitable opportunity to develop and put into practice, new behaviours, knowledge and skills. As such, an apprentice is first and foremost a School employee who is undertaking a structured development programme, and all other School employment policies therefore apply. Policy Aims This policy outlines the School’s overall commitment to supporting apprenticeships for the development of its staff and the betterment of its workforce. Whilst the School recognises that in future it may consider offering to deliver apprenticeship training to employees of other organisations, this is not within the scope of the policy. Staff Apprenticeships Policy Operational 2 Policy Principles Equity, Diversity and Inclusion The School is committed to equality of respect and opportunity, and recognises that apprenticeships can provide development and/or access to employment to those who may not have the opportunity to gain qualifications via traditional study routes. The School is also committed to proactively using apprenticeships to support the career development of staff groups currently under -represented in higher salary banded roles. Providing Opportunity For an individual, apprenticeships are in effect, fee free study. The School needs to ensure this opportunity is offered out fairly, whilst balancing operational requirements, and ensuring compliance with funding rules. Apprenticeships will always need to be relevant to the workplace, either to the employee’s current post, or to their future career plan. The eligibility of both the employee and post is defined by the funding rules. To ensure accessibility to apprenticeships, where possible and operationally viable the School will consider variations of tasks to ensure employees have the opportunity to gain new knowledge, skills and behaviours, and put learning into practice. If more than one employee is interested in an apprenticeship opportunity, a selecti on process may be used. This can mirror LSE recruitment processes, but will also allow for nomination by managers; successful apprenticeships require support and involvement from the employee’s line manager. The School will also consider where its appren ticeship levy may be able to be transferred to another employer. This does not necessarily need to be an employer in the School’s supply chain, but the arrangement should be one that contributes to the betterment of society. Support to Succeed While an employee is on an apprenticeship, at least 20% of their working time needs to be spent on apprenticeship -related activities. Apprenticeship training can be delivered in a variety of ways, including face to face meetings on and off site, classroom workshop s, e-learning, and self -guided study. While they are developing and evidencing additional knowledge, skills and behaviours, employees may need additional support in managing themselves, their workload, and their time. Any issues should be raised early to ensure suitable support is sourced and put into place. Before the apprenticeship and throughout it, the School will work with employees, managers and with training providers to ensure all course delivery is suitable for the employee and the role. Managers and employees on an apprenticeship should meet regularly to discuss all aspects of the apprenticeship, including success rates, self- management, and time / workload management. Employees are encouraged to communicate with their manager – and wher e necessary, their training provider – to raise any concerns. 3 Fairness of Reward and Remuneration Government apprenticeship funding rules outline expectations for employees and employers in regards to remuneration for apprentices. However, the ‘apprenti ceship wage’ is far lower than School salary scales and the School is committed to paying the London Living Wage, including for those undertaking apprenticeships. In most cases, employees will be undertaking apprenticeships to enhance their skills whilst continuing to deliver the full requirements of their roles; in these circumstances the normal salary band for the role will apply. In cases where an employee undertaking an apprenticeship is not yet able to deliver the full requirements of a role until th ey have completed their apprenticeship, in part or in full, the School may consider varying their salary until they are appropriately equipped to deliver the role. This would be subject to the following conditions: - This would be a temporary arrangement while the employee is doing their apprenticeship and they are gaining the skills they need in order to do their current job. - All salary payments will be within School salary scales – at no point would an employee be paid less than Step 1.0 of Salary Band 1. - The employee will be paid one increment below the bottom of the normal Salary Band for every year that their apprenticeship is expected to last – e.g. a two year apprenticeship will lead to a starting salary two increments below the normal entry point. - Automatic increments will apply in the normal way. - Managers can accelerate increments in the contribution round should the employee master the skills required for the role quicker than anticipated. Managers will have the discretion to use the saving made during this period to resource the aspects of the role not undertaken by the employee and/or to recognise the contribution of other team members whose workload is impacted by this arrangement, e.g. via a responsibility allowance. These arrangements will allow the School to balance and reflect the contributions of both the employee who is receiving the apprenticeship investment and development related activities, and of their peers who are currently delivering the role requirements in full. Workforce Deve lopment Apprenticeships add to the range of development and progression opportunities currently available to School staff, supporting staff engagement activities, retaining expertise within the School and enabling the School to maintain its competitive ed ge as an employer. They allow formal qualifications to be more accessible to a wider range of people, giving current and new staff an opportunity to develop new skills. They can be used to bridge skills gaps in hard to fill roles, or to support delivery of strategic business plans. They support better talent management, efficient workforce development and succession planning, and therefore, reduction of recruitment costs. The School will proactively identify apprenticeship opportunities, considering and utilising apprenticeships in wider staff management processes, including change management, recruitment and selection, workforce development, and succession planning. The School will also consider where current development programmes could run alongside, or be transformed into apprenticeships. 4 Managers will be encouraged to consider using apprenticeships for staff mobility – to fill vacant posts, to support secondments and project work, and to cover periods of extended leave. Staff and managers are invi ted to consider apprenticeships throughout the performance appraisal process, and through individual, role or department training needs analysis. Mutual Commitment to Quality The School contributes to the apprenticeship levy, and therefore includes levy funds in the resources it has available for the development of its staff. This will be reflected in the way the School will work with staff and managers to select excellent training providers that offer quality programmes, delivered in a way that suits the employee, the manager, the content and the role. The School also expects staff and managers to take all steps to make the most of the opportunity; engaging with providers an d being clear about the expectations of each party, completing all required work and paperwork, regularly communicating and meeting to ensure positive outcomes and mutual satisfaction, and exploring ways to add additional value both to the School, and to t he staff member. Adding Value Recognising the investment the School is required to make into the levy, it will seek to quantify return on that investment. This will include setting targets for apprenticeship uptake across the school, and confirming indicators for measurement of success. The School aims to become a sector leader in the effective use of apprenticeships and the apprenticeship levy for staff development. It will seek continuous improvement in the effective use of apprenticeships, and w ill regularly benchmark itself against others to understand progress and identify additional opportunities. 5 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 1 year 20/12 /19 20/10 /19 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 22/11 /2018 JNICC Contacts Position Name Email Notes HR Policy Lisa Morrow l.morrow@lse.ac.uk Organisational Learning Chris Watt c.watt@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

Policy a) Employees are entitled to appeal using this procedure, against any decisions made in accordance with the disciplinary, dismissals, capability - performance, capacity - health, redundancy, grievance or anti-harassment procedures. b) An appeal hearing is the means by which the School, acting as a reasonable employer, provides those employees who wish to do so, with a consistent forum in which to present a case arguing that the action taken against them has been unfair. c) If the employee is able to demons trate that the action taken against him or her was unfair, the appeal is the means by which decisions made are formally withdrawn or amended. If they are unable to do so, the fairness of the action will be confirmed and upheld. d) The function of an appe al is not to conduct a full rehearing of the facts of the case, though it is inevitable that reference will have to be made to the earlier hearing. Usual grounds for an appeal will therefore be the coming to light of new information, procedural irregularities or alleged unreasonableness of the decision. 2. Scope of the procedure a) This procedure applies to all Academic Support Staff. b) For the purposes of this procedure the term \"employee\" will also include former employees Appeals policy and procedure for academic support staff Operational 2 who were dismissed in accorda nce with any of the following School\\'s policies: • Disciplinary and Dismissals Policy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff, • Dismissals Procedure for Academic Support Staff • Capability – Performance Policy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff, • Capacity – Health Policy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff, • Redundancy Procedure for Academic Support Staff • Grievance Procedure for Academic Support Staff • Anti-Harassment Procedure for Academic Support Staff. c) Where a grievance is raised in connection with one of the procedures listed above it will be considered under this Appeals procedure. 3. Exclusions a) This procedure does not apply to decisions made using the modified grievance procedure. 4. Roles and responsibilities a) Employees have a responsibility to: • submit an appeal in accordance with the procedure • clearly state the basis of his/her appeal and provide all the relevant details; • attend meetings held under the appeals procedure and provide the relevant details in relation to the appeal. c) Managers who have made a decision have a responsibility to: • be able to clearly explain the reasons behind a decision in respect of an appeal and provide any necessary details if a hearing is held. d) To ensure consistency of the application of this procedure, managers must seek the advice of their HR Partner before making any decisions. e) Should an employee need assistance in understanding either the policy or procedure or any documentation in co nnection with this, he/she should seek advice from their HR Partner or a trade union representative. Should an employee need assistance in setting out an appeal, he/she can seek advice from a work colleague or a trade union representative. HR does not prov ide employees with specific advice relating to individual circumstances. 5. Appeals procedure a) An employee wishing to appeal against a decision made in accordance with the policies and procedures covered by this procedure, as detailed in paragraph 1(a), should inform the Human Resources Director (or the Deputy Director in the event of a decision made by the Human Resources Director in the case of the harassment procedure) in writing setting out in full the reasons for the appeal, and attaching any support ing documentation. This should be done within five working days of receipt of written confirmation of the decision. 3 b) A copy of the appeal will be passed to the manager or, if applicable, the Human Resources Director who made the decision for him/her to prepare a written response, which s/he will present at the appeal hearing. c) A copy of this statement will be sent to the employee with the required notification of the hearing, normally within ten days of receiving the employee\\'s notification of appe al. d) As far as possible, hearings are held within fifteen working days of receiving the notification of appeal. 6.

       "  'text': \" 1. INTRODUCTION The School recognises the positive impact that flexible working can have on an individual, their wellbeing, engagement and productivity. The School strives to positively support all employees from all backgrounds and the LSE Flexible Working policy supports this. Flexible working can vary in shape and form, from a formal change in contracted hours to a change of work location, and is dependent upon both the employee and employer working together to meet the mutual needs of the individual and the School. The LSE campus is at the heart of all activities and its community. It is the hub from which the School operates, and which is part of its identity for many students, visitors, collaborators and partners, bringing together global academics, researchers and policy makers. Staff on academic terms and conditions are expected to make a full range of contributions across research, education and citizenship. The revised 2020 LSE Academic Staff terms and conditions state that ‘All academic staff are expected to attend the School where necessary to carry out their contractual duties. These duties include teaching, office hours, departmental meetings and other in person academic support meetings’. Whilst remote working tools can assist in achieving virtual presence, nevertheless it is not a full substitute for regular physical presence. As a campus -based university, employment at LSE carries it with a strong expectation of presence on the School campus. Understandably, there are occasional ly events in the lives of members of the School community that prompt them to request a period of living and working abroad (which is distinct from a request to change working pattern which is covered by our flexible working policy). Where staff make this request, they and their manager will be required to follow the policy principles and process set out below. Each request will be dealt with on its merits and circumstances, but the decision shall be at the sole discretion of the School. 2. POLICY AIMS This policy aims to outline the School’s principles / position surrounding those occasions where staff request to work overseas on a long term or permanent basis for personal reasons or work - related reasons. The policy outlines the key considerations for working overseas and aims to Operational LSE Policy for Staff on UK contracts requesting to work abroad for personal reasons  2 guide LSE management in considering how to proceed with these requests, with support and guidance from HR Partners. 3. POLICY SCOPE This policy relates to all salaried staff in professional services, academic, teaching/education and research staff groups whether on a short term or long- term fixed contract or a permanent or open - ended contract with LSE. It also recognises that remot e working from abroad is not possible in many roles, including but not limited t o teaching and advisory roles that require face to face contact with students, staff who support teaching and the student experience, as well as facilities roles within the Estates Division and other roles within Residential and Catering Services Division. This policy excludes individuals who are frontier workers or are considering a request for cross - border working. Such circumstances are covered in the School’s policy for staff on UK contracts requesting arrangements as frontier workers or cross -border workers. 3.1 Considering t emporary and short term overseas working requests for personal reasons Exceptionally, the School will consider requests for flexibility in location on a temporary short term ( over 28 days up to 6 months) basis in any period of 12 months at the School ’s discretion and only when the School agrees and accepts the conditions agreed. The 28 days is based on working days and not calendar days, and it is cumulative over a rolling period of 12 months. This does not include period s of annual leave, public holidays or unpaid leave. For example, an academic wants to spend annual leave over the winter break overseas and plans to work a couple of weeks after this remotely in the same country. If this request happens in two or three holidays over the year, these short periods of remote working, may be come cumulatively 28 days or over in a rolling 12 month period. 3.2 Considering t emporary and short term overseas working requests for r esearch activity Faculty who undertake research abroad during sabbatical leave do not normally need permission to do so. The same holds for faculty and research staff undertaking research abroad as part of their normal duties on a short -term basis. However, t heir work is sometimes a discrete part of a larger project or an independent project entirely which needs to be based overseas temporarily. T here are certain European double tax treaty reliefs for professorial and researc h1 roles when working overseas temporarily (2 years) for work -related reasons; in these cases, it is advised that specific advice is obtained on a case by case basis in order to make the appropriate assessment on how this may be applicable. The School expec ts any faculty and research staff carrying out research overseas to continue to build our research community and continue institution building – bringing new research opportunities to LSE and in turn strengthening the teaching experience for our students. as well as bringing research to School and to support our students. 3.3 LSE o bligations overseas Except for specific circumstances, outlined in 3.3.1, LSE does not have the mechanism to arrange to pay and employ s taff who are based overseas, outside the UK for a permanent period or longer than a 6 month period (in any given 12 month period) and LSE will not normally pay salaries 1 In some countries this could also include P hD students.  3 overseas even on a short term basis. There are costs to making such arrangements, including legal, tax and payroll costs, that are not covered within an LSE budget or plans. 3.3.1 LSE o verseas registered offices In response to a specific and large funding requirement to be based overseas permanently for demand- led economic policy research working with local government policy makers, LSE has established operations based overseas with registered branch offices in Africa and South Asia where there are staff who are engaged through local operations (local employment contracts and payroll). Where an LSE s taff member is able to work temporarily in one of these countries and is engaged on any type of LSE contract, then considerations will need to be made according to the residency, immigration and social security withholding legislation as well as costs of these liabilities. Full considerations need to be made before authorising such longer -term arrangements in those countries. In these cases, the HR Partner will be able to seek appropriate advice. 4. POLICY PRINCIPLES This policy aims to outline the guiding princi ples for staff and managers when requesting temporary overseas relocation for personal reasons. It should be noted that the School will not be able to bear any of the additional cost that arise to the employee and the School as a result of the individual choosing for personal reasons to reside outside the UK whilst employed by LSE 2. It is not possible for LSE to employ staff on a permanent basis where the intention is that their formal work location is abroad based on a personal request. Such arrangements do exist on an exceptional basis for some staff (e.g. ICG Country based contract s, but do require complex arrangements including in setting up a presence in the country, a localised pay administrator to comply with local taxation, and tailored pension and benefits arrangements. It would not be practical nor economical for this to be an option for staff on UK contracts. The expected main location and place of work is set out in all LSE offer of appointment letters and/or terms and conditions which are governed by the laws of the UK. Under this policy, LSE will not normally be able to support individual personal requests f or tempor ary overseas working arrangements, except on an exceptional basis, based on personal circumstances, the job role, the length of the temporary period of cover and whether there are other benefits to the School of a member being based abroad temporarily. All line managers are responsible for respecting the policy and its principles to seek guidance from their HR Partner and Finance team before agreeing to any arrangement taking place even if they support the request. When an individual makes a reques t for temporary overseas working, their manager or department/division will need to speak to the individual and consider many factors such as those outlined below, in consultation with their HR Partner (refer to Appendix A for information on the key consid erations) : a) Clarify the details of the plan, including timelines, to live abroad temporarily and agree the period of time, including all dates b) Discuss any significant changes in a staff m ember’s personal circumstances that they want to share c) Consider the contractual relationship including the type and whether it is at the end of the contractual period d) If the individual works independently or manages / leads a team: can they fulfil all of the duties of their post whilst working abroad? Ensuring that any relocation will not place 2 Subject to provisions in the School’s policy for staff on UK contracts requesting arrangements as frontier workers or cross -border workers  4 additional demands on their team; that there will be no adverse impact on the role being carried out or to any colleagues, students or other stakeholders. e) Ensure that there will be no additional financial cost to the School because of the temporary relocation arrangement. If there will be any material increase in cost to the School of them relocating overseas in terms of additional tax, social security, National Insurance and other insurance and administrative costs then this will be borne by the individual. f) If they have one, does their visa permit facilitate this? Will they need a visa to do so? Will this affect any UK visa or permit currently held? g) Where applicable, will their funder allow the move? h) Could the staff member carry out the work without creating a ‘Permanent Establishment’ for tax purposes in the overseas location? i) By being based overseas, when fulfilling their responsibility in the UK or on campus means that any expenses are the responsibility of the individual - such as travel from or to the UK, subsistence or accommodation in the UK or in the temporary location, will not be reimbursed by the School. 5. PROCEDURE The expected main place of work is set out in all LSE offer of appointment letters and/or terms and conditions which are governed by the laws of the UK and it is expected that s taff are resident and work under this jurisdiction. In the first instance, the staff member is required to talk to their line manager about their request to relocate abroad on a temporary basis. The line manager, in consultation with the HR Partner, should assess the individual case. If the case is supported, then the relevant application form should be completed (Appendix B ). 5.1 Process for all staff requests The staff member needs to receive formal authorisation from their manager and the School before making any plans for moving abroad for personal reasons on a temporary basis (3 -6 months in any 12 month period). The below steps form the policy process guidelines: a. The staff member must inform their manager, department or centre manager or Head of Department/Division that they are or plan to be based temporarily overseas providing details and their reasons as soon as they start making plans. b. Together they will consider and discuss the situation and if the manager is supportive, they need to request to meet with their HR Partner. c. The staff member and their management team will need to complete the LSE International Working Approval Form (Appendix B ) in order to obtain LSE Finance, and LSE HR Approval o In making the application to work overseas the staff member will need to obtain independent financial advice in the UK and in the country they are based and share that with HR and Finance : by doing so the staff member will need to review all local rules and independent financial advice for their situation. o The staff member will be liable for all associated costs incurred by both themselves and LSE (including any legal, financial advice and on- going cost s). d. HR will liaise with LSE Finance where Taxation issues should be referred to the School’s Tax Manager as per the LSE Financial Regulations. o LSE cannot meet foreign taxation liabilities in overseas countries for individuals and does not have the resources to operate the requirements of any local tax and social security obligations in such isolated cases. Where an employee or their  5 independent tax advisor completes a P85 form for the Staff member to complete, the staff member is expected to speak t o their manager, HR Partner and LSE ’s Payroll team before completing and submitting the form. o Social Security: Temporary posting of the staff member to an EU Member State will be governed by the EU -UK Trade and Cooperation agreement, which includes a prot ocol on Social Security Coordination (the Protocol). Under the Protocol in certain circumstances a person who is sent by their employer in the UK to work temporarily in an EU Member State (for a temporary period) can continue to pay contributions only in t heir home state (UK). A system of portable documents (A1) exists to ensure that the worker does not also have to pay contributions in the Member State they are posted to. LSE will not normally be able to support individual personal requests for temporary overseas working arrangements EU Member State when they are not successful in obtaining an A1 from HMRC as this will result in complex arrangements including in setting up a presence in the country, and engaging a localised pay administrator to comply with local social security rules. ii. HR will also liaise with Health & Safety to consider any declarati ons required from the staff member to ensure that the place of temporary work complies with the policies of the School. 5.2 Options and outcome of requests The School LSE Finance and LSE HR teams 3 will decide on whether the individual will be allowed to work overseas for the length of period requested. The staff member will need to review all local rules and seek independent personal financial advice which LSE Finance will procure (and pass all associated costs to the staff member). The staff member will be liable for all associated costs incurred by both themselves and for LSE. The options and outcomes avail able to LSE staff based on this policy and its principles are as follows: a) A request is approved on an exceptional basis because it is possible to carry out the full duties of the role from a location abroad for a period of up to 6 months and the conditions relating to taxation, immigration and pensions are not a barrier. However, it is highly unlikely that a period exceeding 6 months can be approved because the costs that the employee would have to bear would be prohibitive. Where the par ticular circumstances of the case makes this possible and the employee is able to meet the cost of personal and School advice or charges relating to taxation, immigration and pensions this may be approved. A key factor in this being considered will be the specific country in which they plan to be based. b) An interim solution is agreed upon by all parties where the staff member is transferred to an overseas consultant contract and will forego their employment rights (including continuity of service, pension and other benefits) for a ‘true’ consultant arrangement. This means considerations will need to be made regarding any management and other duties that will need to be relinquished and passed to team members at no additional cost to LSE as well as other factors such as School assets being returned. This would normally be considered for period of 12 months or more. c) The request is rejected. Any failure to follow the procedure or to comply with any variation could be deemed to be an act of gross misconduct. 3 This will typically be the HR Partner in consultation with the Assistant Finance Director and Head of Financial Control and Compliance with advice from the LSE Tax Manager. In some cases, it may be necessary for the HR Director and Finance Director to make the final decision. 6 I S/HR Division August 2021 Reviewed and updated April 2024 Page 1 of 3 Appendix A: Key considerations when working overseas LSE could exceptionally agree to staff members temporarily based overseas for different reasons in various scenarios. In order for staff to work in any country on a UK based employment contract, the following and adduce for the staff member to take The period of time based overseas is the principle and key aspect to consider as it will have implications on all of these elements: i. Residency: Each c ountry will have different rules and thresholds which trigger residency. Factors such as nationality, pattern of travel, previous residence in the UK/home country and intention will feed into the local decisions. These need to be understood and assessed on a country by country and individual basis. For example, information on UK residency can be found on the government webpages here. ii. Taxation considerations: Taxation will be driven primarily by your residency status, see section i) above, but can also arise in a country where you are working for a significant period, even if not resident there. In addition to UK HM RC rules there will be different rules to consider and which may apply in other countries. This is particularly important if residency is triggered in that location. The rules will be different for each individual scenario and you can find more information on other residency information here. There are certain European double tax treaty reliefs for professorial, PhD and research roles when working overseas temporarily for work reasons; in these cases it is advised that specific advice be obtained in order to make the appropriate assessment on how this can be applicable. The UK HMRC rules mean that any UK resident who is outside the UK for longer tha n a set number of days per year and have connections to the country (e.g. nationality, rented property, registration with a local health authority, etc.) risks breaking their UK tax residency and triggering residency and perhaps tax residency in that locat ion. Additionally, the UK HMRC has generic double taxation treaties in place with a number of countries, and states, which permits people to move overseas for a short term stay, usually limited up to a certain amount of days for non -residents and has certain rules around settlement that could trigger residency for the ind ividual in that country. You will need to review these rules and take independent financial advice on these for your situation from an LSE Finance procured advisor. You will be liable for all associated costs incurred by yourself or the LSE. For anyone te mporarily based abroad the question arises of when the activity may trigger a permanent establishment (PE) which could happen at the beginning of the stay or over a sh ort period of time depending on your activity in the country. There are several baseline tests for PE used in most tax treaties and domestic tax law and certain activity over a period of time could create PE and the resulting tax liability for you and LSE. Each case would need to be reviewed in order to comply with these local rules and to test the engagement. If this was triggered, this may mean that LSE would have to register in that country, arrange local payroll services and have local employment statut ory contractual obligations. If this becomes a risk, LSE will have to consider the option of terminating the employment contract. Page 2 of 3 iii. Immigration considerations: Authorisation1 to work in each country will be different and therefore compliance with any entry visa or work permit is required if this is needed. It is worth checking that you are complying with these entry and stay duration regulations where needed. The Staff member will need to provide evidence of their right to work for HR records and declare any changes that occur to their circumstance or the visa. If the member of staff are sponsored by LSE to work in the UK under any UKVI visa, then working overseas may compromise the validity of their visa. The staff member would need to contact the HR Visa te am in the first instance for advice and information related to your sponsorship requirements as well as to inform them of their intentions. iv. Social Security considerations: If the country where the Staff member is working in has a Reciprocal Agreement or Double Contribution Convention (sometimes called ‘bilateral Social Security agreements’), the employee will usually pay social security contributions in that country instead of National Insurance. The social security implications of living out side the UK will impact on the employee’s health care and benefits payments in the UK and in the country of residence. The employee should ensure they fully understand their rights and responsibilities. Social security costs in other countries can be muc h higher than in the UK for employee and employer. Any additional employer costs including advice and setting up costs necessary to withhold overseas social security contributions, will be the responsibility of the employee. v. Statutory benefits in the UK for staff temporarily based overseas: Staff will continue to be entitled to UK statutory benefits such as maternity leave and pay, paternity leave and pay, sick pay and sickness absence as long as they remain eligible for these and also continue to pay their National Insurance in the UK [reference HMRC webpages below]. These rights may be affected depending on the location and length of arrangement in place; in these circumstances the School may have to take local advice and St aff will need to incur all costs associated with the advice. More information on the statutory benefit provisions in the UK can be found on the government website. Additionally, the OECD model treaty and most (if not all) bilateral tax treaties refer to ‘physical presence for periods not exceeding 183 days’ rather than ‘workdays’. All days spent in the work countr y, including work days, weekend days, public holidays, vacation days and sick days will count towards the limit in that country. This means that any sickness absence or maternity/paternity/adoption leave period whilst being based abroad will contribute to the time or ‘presence’ spent in the country for that rolling 12 month period. vi. Health & Safety considerations such as in country health and safety laws may be different to the UK. Home working assessments are available for those working overseas, please c ontact the LSE Health and Safety team for details (health.and.saftey@lse.ac.uk). 1 Obtaining work authorisation can take some time in the UK and overseas and immigration advice should be sought approximately 3 months in advance of any move to allow time to obtain this. Page 3 of 3 vii. Summary of implications for both the Staff member and LSE, which may be impacted by being based temporarily overseas include: Key factors for the individual to note a) you may be required to agree a variation to your terms and conditions which may revoke your e mploymen t rights in the UK and applicable in the overseas country which includes local terms and conditions including local statutory rights b) UK occupational and statutory pension membership compromised from outset c) you may not be eligible for cover of LSE travel in surance d) effects on social security obligations and social insurance benefits in both UK and overseas country e) different and/or additional tax liabilities f) health care access for you (and your family) compromised in the UK and also the country you are based in g) Immigration requirements of the country you are based in and right to work h) additional costs associated with necessary advice to or actions by LSE borne by you i) current right to work/sponsorship in the UK Key Factors for the LSE a) corporate liability including accounting, accountability and legal assistance for PE b) tax withholding obligations and social security payments from first day c) local statutory employment rights for the individual which are different to UK d) additional burden that there i s a strong enough connection with the UK to be able to bring UK claims e) issues over confidentiality and employment covenants f) data protection considerations g) insurance and health & safety issues Appendix B: LSE Overseas Working Arrangement Approval Form This is a read-only v ersion of the form.

INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDELINES These guidelines provide information about the processes and criteria governing review and promotion of Assistant and Associate Professors as well as post-Major Review Lecturers. The Promotions Committee (a sub-committee of the Appointments Committee of which the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) is the Chair) is the formal School body that reaches decisions about the success of all review and promotion proposals. Decisions about success at Interim Review, Major Review or about success for promotion proposals are made solely on merit, as gauged by the staff member’s research and scholarship, teaching, and the contribution they are making to the work of the Department and the School. Review and promotion considerations will take account of the School\\'s Policy Statement on Equality and Diversity and will recognise the existence of non- standard and interrupted careers. The Promotions Committee\\'s terms of reference and membership for the current session, are set out at Annex A and Annex B to these Guidelines as well as being available on the Human Resources website. Please note that where the Guidance refers to \"normally\" or \"in an exceptional case\", it is at the discretion of the Vice Chair of the Appointments Committee, in the first instance, whether the rules can be waived. Heads of Department must consult with the Vice Chair of the Appointments Committee as early as possible if they think they are dealing with an exception to any part of the Guidance. The Promotions Committee recognises that successful academic careers can take a variety of forms and that the indi vidual trajectories of candidates need to be evaluated holistically. If any member of staff has concerns about the review and promotion process, whether at School or Department level, they are entitled to raise this formally or informally with the Vice Chair of the Appointments Committee who will take appropriate further steps to investigate and act upon those concerns. 1.1 Vice-Chair of Appointments Committee (VCAC) Professor Niamh M oloney is the Vice -Chair of the Appointments Committee (VCAC) The VCAC may be contacted at N.Moloney@lse.ac.uk for advice on specific cases throughout the session. The VCAC works closely with the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development), Professor Charles Stafford. 1.2 Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Review and Promotion The Promotions Committee is aware that the Covid -19 pandemic has had a very significant, and in some cases dramatic, impact on the work of colleagues in the School. Where relevant information about this is provided, it will be taken into account in the evaluation of review and promotion cases. This can be provided on the Head of Department’s Statement G/1; on the CV template G/2 (in a dedicated section that has been added for the declaration of Covid -19 impacts), as well as on the addenda to the CV – that is, the additional statements on research ac hievements, research trajectory, contributions to education and contributions to citizenship; on the Request for Deferral G/7; on the Optional Declaration of Individual Circumstances G/8 (in particular, where the impacts to be declared are confidential in nature); and on the Self-sponsored Promotion Proposal – Candidate’s Statement G/9 in cases of self -sponsorship. 1.3 Introduction to Interim Review and Major Review with Promotion to Associate  6 Professor The LSE believes strongly in developing the potential of all staff who are recruited to the School. It is also recognised that individuals will be appointed who are at different stages of their academic careers and considers that a process of structured review is beneficial to both Assistant Professors and the School. A review process operates for Assistant Professors new to the School which is divided into two stages: Interim Review and Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor. The purpose of these two review processes is to provide the opportunity for detailed and careful consideration of progress against the agreed criteria. An Assistant Professor without a proven track record regarding either teaching or research can expect to be appointed subject to both Interim Review and Major Review. Interim Review may be waived and an Assistant Professor appointed subject to Major Rev iew only where there is an established record of teaching and research. Departments will be notified at appropriate times by Human Resources on an individual basis of when their Assistant Professors are scheduled to undergo Interim Review or Major Review. For further details of the aim of Interim Review and Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor, please see Sections 3.1 and 3.4, respectively. 1.4 Introduction to Promotion to Associate Professor for post -Major Review Lecturers or Assistant Professors Post-Major Review Lecturers who opt into the New Academic Career become post-Major Review Assistant Professors. Lecturers who have already passed Major Review can be put forward for promotion to Associate Professor by their Department or can self-spon sor a promotion case (with or without having opted into the New Academic Career before their case is submitted for consideration by the Promotions Committee). They will be considered only for promotion to Associate Professor and will not undergo Major Revi ew a second time and the criteria for promotion to Associate Professor will apply. Successful promotion to Associate Professor signifies the candidate\\'s intent to opt in to the New Academic Career structure (if they have not done so already), and the New A cademic Career structure terms and conditions will be effective from the following 1 August. 1.5 Departmental Sponsorship for Promotion Responsibility for deciding whether to put Assistant Professors (or Lecturers) forward for promotion to Associate Professor or (full) Professor lies with the Head of Department and Professors within a Department (see Section 4) unless a candidate self-sponsors a promotion case (see Sections 1.6 and 9.3). Heads of Department should ensure that the decision not to support a candidate is conveyed to the member of staff sufficiently in advance of the published deadlines for submis sion of self-sponsored promotion proposals to Human Resources to allow time should the member of staff elect to proceed under this route. 1.6 Introduction to the Self -Sponsored Promotion Route Associate Professors may propose their own promotion to (full) Pr ofessor, and post -Major Review Lecturers/Assistant Professors may propose their own Promotion to Associate Professor, if their Departments do not intend to recommend them. All members of academic staff are notified of the annual Promotion and Review timetable and corresponding deadlines for submission of promotion proposals by Human Resources.  7 Members of academic staff electing to proceed under the self-sponsored route are encouraged to seek a meeting with the VCAC to discuss their case. A reference guide to the deadlines and documentation can be found at Annex D, and the procedure is dealt with under Section 9.3. 1.7 Optional Declaration of Individual Circumstances The School expects that if staff members\\' individual circumstances are affecting their day - to- day activities or performance the individual would have raised these at the earliest opportunity with their Department and the Department will have addressed these issues, with the advice of Human Resources, as soon as reasonably possible. Furthermore, the School expects that most circumstances do not need to be stated on the Optional Declaration of Individual Circumstances Form G/8 as these can be resolved through local discussion. For advice please consult the relevant HR Partner in the first instance. If the circumstances are exceptional then the Promotions Committee will, where necessary, consider the effect of a candidate\\'s individual circumstances on their career progression where information has been provided by the candidate and, where the candidate so wishes, by the Head of Department. The following are examples of individual circumstances that might apply where these have had a significant impact on progress and performance: \\uf0a7 Disability as defined by the Equality Act 2010, for example conditions such as cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome and mental health conditions \\uf0a7 Other instances of ill health or injury not covered above \\uf0a7 Constraints relating to pregnancy, maternity, breastfeeding, adoption, paternity or childcare in addition to periods of parental leave taken. This could include, for example, pregnancy related illness or the health of a child \\uf0a7 Other caring responsibilities (for example caring for an elderly, ill, or disabled relative) \\uf0a7 Other significant life event, for example gender reassignment or bereavement of a family member Please note that interruptions in service due to maternity leave, adoption leave, additional paternity leave, shared parental leave, secondment or special leave buy out should be declared on the Curriculum Vitae Template G/2. For pre-Interim Review and pre-Major Review candidates with periods of parental leave or long-term sickness please also see Section 2.7 – Automatic Interruption and Stopping of the Review ‘Clock’. The Optional Declaration of Individual Circumstances Form G/8 should be completed and signed by the candidate and, where the candidate so wishes, the Head of Department. The information provided on this form, with advice from the Department\\'s HR Partner, will inform the VCAC’s advice to the Promotions Committee as to the nature of the circumstances, the support being provided and whether any other adjustments are necessary (e.g. reasonable adjustments in case of a disability). The details of the circumstances will not be disclosed to the Promotions Committee. Please note that if there are personal circumstances that are affecting the day -to-day activities or performance of the candidate which are not declared on the form by the deadline on the form, the Promotions Committee may not be able to take account of them in its decision on the case. In cases where the Optional Declaration of Individual Ci rcumstances Form G/8 has been submitted, the VCAC and Human Resources may gather further information on the background of the case. Human Resources may, if the candidate has informed the Head of  8 Department of the individual circumstances, request a more detailed statement from the Head of Department (including in self-sponsored cases) to aid advice to the VCAC (this information will not be shared with the Promotions Committee) and may include information such as the following: \\uf0a7 A description of the situation \\uf0a7 The effect it has had on the candidate\\'s ability to carry out their duties \\uf0a7 Details of any Doctors notes, OH referrals, specialist reports and recommendations (where applicable) \\uf0a7 Action taken by the Department, including any reasonable adjustments made to the candidate’s role in the Department, flexible working arrangements, mentoring, \\uf0a7 Departmental commitments including administration \\uf0a7 The effectiveness of those adjustments in increasing the candidate\\'s ability to carry out their duties \\uf0a7 Career advice given in Academic Staff Career Development Review (CDR) meetings and agreed actions. The Promotions Committee will give careful consideration to the VCAC\\'s indication of the severity and impact of the circumstances and may make recommendations to the Department and/or the candidate regarding the candidate\\'s future career progression at the School. Please refer to Annexes C and D for the deadline of submission of the Optional Declaration of Individual Circumstances Form G/8. 1.8 Disability and the Promotion Process The School’s commitment to providing and developing a positive, supportive and enabling environment for all staff extends to the promotion process in particular and the career development of staff in general. As part of this commitment, a disability which is having a significant impact on an individual’s progress and/or performance may be raised and considered under 1.7 – Optional Declaration of Individual Circumstances. In addition, Heads of Department (and other individuals with management and/or oversight responsibilities) have a role to play in ensuring that disabled staff under the New Academic Career are supported throughout the promotion process, including the agreement and implementation of reasonable adjustments. Similar expectations apply to the C areer Development Review process. The relevant HR Partner can provide gui dance about what could be considered ‘reasonable’ in a given situation. As outlined in 1.7, the impact of a disability on an individual’s progress will be relayed to the Promotions Committee by the VCAC along with any recommended adjustments to process. A decision on the case will take the information into account when considering the requirements for promotion as outlined in Section 2. The information provided by the VCAC will be based on discussions with the Head of Department and/or the HR Partner and will take into account the need for reasonable adjustments to be made based on the individual circumstances. In order to ensure that departmental promotions processes also take account of any reasonable adjustments which might be made for an individual, Heads of Department should contact the VCAC to ask for advice where a disabled individual is being considered for promotion within their department. Prior to a case reaching the Promotions Committee, it is expected that both individuals and departments will have received support and advice in helping a disabled member of the New Academic Career staff to progress in their career. Further information can be found in the  9 Career Development Review Guidance. 1.9 Part-Time Staff Interim and Major Reviews for part-time staff will normally take place according to the same schedule as Review for full -time staff. The Promotions Committee expects that part-time staff will have an academic profile of equivalent quality to that of full -time staff undergoing Interim Review, Major Review or promotion. However, the Committee accepts that the quantity across the range of academic activities will be commensurate with the part-time appointment. The VCAC may be contacted for advice on specific cases. 1.10 Interviews Consideration of Interim Review, Major Review, and promotion proposals by the Promotions Committee is a documented process based on evaluation of written reports and materials. There is no entitlement to interview for either the candidate or the Head of Department, although in exceptional circumstances the Promotions Committee may invite a Head of Department or, for self-sponsored promotion cases, the candidate to attend – if, for example, there is a need for factual clarification in a particular case. Wherever possible, Heads of Department (and in the case of self- sponsorship, the self-sponsored candidate) should be in the School and available on the dates the Promotions Committee meets (in the Winter Term ) to consider Major Reviews and promotions (dates of this session’s meetings are available at Annex C of these Guidelines and on the Human Resources website. 1.11 Submission of Documentation and Deadlines for Submission The current session deadlines for submissi on of documentation to Human Resources are set out in the Promotion and Review Timetable and Reference Guide to Deadlines for Review and Promotion Documentation ( Annex C and D of these Guidelines, respectively). Heads of Department are responsible for forw arding all documentation to Human Resources by no later than the specified dates. In cases of self-sponsored promotion the individual may submit the promotion documentation directly to Human Resources (or via their Head of Department as desired) in accordance with the deadlines for submission. Failure to submit materials by the due date may preclude consideration of the case. 1.12 Department of Management The Department of Management was originally organised on a federal basis around a number of different disciplines and subject Groups, but these Groups have since been discontinued. All proposals for academic promotions and reviews will therefore be considered as originating from the Department of Management, through the Head of Department, and not from any subject groupings or research and teaching clusters that may exist within the Department. 1.13 GDPR and Data Protection - Confidentiality of Promotion and the Review Process The Promotions Committee complies with the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 as amended, in processing personal data in relation to consideration of individual promotion and review cases.  10 All persons asked to provide statements, references and reports about candidates for promotion and review are advised that their documentation is confidential to the Promotions Committee and will be used solely for the purposes of the School\\'s Revi ew and Promotion processes. However, in circumstances such as a Major R eview appeal hearing, grievance or legal proceedings, reports may have to be disclosed to a third party. In the interests of fairness, the Promotions Committee will not accept comments, either written or verbal, from third parties (those from whom comments had not been formally solicited). 1.14 Academic Career Development Review Scheme and Mentoring The Promotions Committee expects that all non -Professorial academics, and particularly those coming up for Interim Review or Major Review, will receive constructive advice on career development from senior academic colleagues. The School has an established Academic Staff Career Development Review (CDR) Scheme and full Guidance is available on the Human Resources website. The Scheme is designed to serve the needs of individual academics, enable Heads of Department to manage staff promotions and reviews, and in that context, to flag at an early stage any issues of concern to the Promotions Committee. The Scheme is designed to facilitate proactive support, mentoring and career guidance for staff throughout their academ ic careers. Heads of Department are responsible for ensuring that the CDR is operating effectively at departmental level, and in particular for ensuring that CDR Meetings for academic staff pre- Major Review take place on an annual basis. They are also responsible for ensuring the CDR forms are submitted to Human Resources for the VCAC’s review. The VCAC, in conjunction with the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) and Human Resources, is responsible for oversight and implementation of the Academic Staff Career Development Review (CDR) Scheme and for reporting on any issues to the Promotions Committee. Mentoring For Assistant Professors the role of the Mentor is of importance in supporting career development. Heads of Department are responsible for ensuring that Assistant Professors are assigned a department Mentor, and for reporting this information to the first meeting of the Promotions Committee every session. The Mentoring Scheme is distinct from the CDR. Mentors give informal and frequent advice and provide a listening ear throughout the year, whereas formal CDR Meetings take place annually for Assistant Professors and are normally conducted by the Head of Department. Importantly, the mentor cannot be the one holding the CDR Meeting. The Assistant Professor’s Mentor and the Head of Department share responsibility for supporting the Assistant Professor towards their Interim Review and Major Review. Assistant Professors who encounter difficulties in the mentoring relationship are advised to discuss the situation with their Head of Department in the first instance to explor e whether a change of Mentor is necessary. The Mentoring Guidelines are available on the Human Resources website. New Assistant Professors are also offered a programme of induction activities run by the Eden Centre. Further information is available on the Eden Centre website. Mentors and Heads of Department are encouraged to contact the Eden Centre for customised, individual advice / training. 1.15 General These Guidelines are subject to periodic review and may be amended or updated as the School considers necessary.  11 2. TIMING OF REVIEW AND PROMOTION IN THE ACADEMIC SESSION 2.1 Timing of Interim Review Departmental nominations for Interim Review can be made in any year, subject to the maximum time limits set out below, allowing for a Department to form a judgement on the quality of a candidate’s work, broader contributions to the School and progress toward Major Review. If candidates are nominated before the maximum time limit, Heads of Department should make the case in their Head of Department Statement G/1 that the candidate is ready to undergo Interim Review, and are encouraged to seek guidance from the VCAC. Interim Reviews are expected to take place in the third year of appointment for Assistant Professors appointed before 2017 and in the fourth year of appointment for Assistant Professors appointed from 2017 onwards. There is scope for the Interim Review to be held earlier or later than this if circumstances warrant the advancement or deferral with a maximum deferral to the fifth year of the appointment. Information about the procedures to follow for deferral of Interim Review is provided in Section 2.7 below. For academic staff appointed from 1 January or later in the Academic session, the first year of appointment shall be counted from the following Autumn Term for the purposes of their scheduled Interim Review date. Certain events also result in an automatic interruption (stopping of the review clock) – see Section 2.8 below. 2.2 Timing of Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor Departmental nominations for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor c an be made in whichever year, but subject to the maximum time limits set out below, as may be required for a Department to form a judgement on the quality of a candidate’s work and broader contributions to the School. If candidates are nominated before the maximum time limit, Heads of Department should make the case in their Head of Department Statement G/1 that the candidate is ready to undergo Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor. Heads of Department are encouraged to seek guidance from the VCAC. For Assistant Professors appointed subject to Interim Review and Major Review, Major Review will normally take place within eight years of the appointment date, though exceptionally an extension of a maximum of one year can be requested where pertinent new information is likely to be forthcoming (further information about the procedures to follow for deferral is provided in Section 2.7 below). For academic staff appointed from 1 January or later in the Academic session, the first year of appointment shall be counted from the following Winter Term for the purposes of their scheduled Major Review date. For Assistant Professors appointed post-Interim Review, the School expects the Major Review normally to take place within five years of the appointment date for Assistant Professors appointed before 2017, and within four years of appointment for Assistant Professors appointed from 2017 onwards. Though exceptionally an extension of a maximum of one year can be requested where pertinent new information is likely to be forthcoming (see also Section 2.7 below). Certain events result in an automatic interruptio n (stopping of the review clock) – see Section 2.8 below. 2.3 Additional Year to Review Schedules for Assistant Professors due to Covid-19 Pandemic At the end of the 2019-20 academic session, the Appointments Committee took the decision to add one year to the Interim Review and/or Major Review schedules of all currently employed Assistant Professors. This was in recognition of the very significant impact of the Covid-19  12 pandemic on many colleagues’ work, and on their research work in particular. If they so wish, Assistant Professors can formally opt out of this additional year facility, although they can also be considered for Interim Review and/or Major Review earlier than their adjusted maximum time limits without having formally opted out. Where an Assistant Professor who has not opted out of the additional year is considered for Interim Review or Major Review before their adjusted maximum time limit and the case is unsucce ssful, the Committee will neither pass nor fail the candidate but rule that the application is premature and should be resubmitted in a future round; the adjusted Interim Review and/or Major Review schedule with the additional year will serve as the maximum time limit. Where an Assistant Professor has formally opted out of the additional year facility, their maximum time limit will be what it would have been prior to the adjustment made to the Interim Review and/or Major Review schedule, i.e. without the additional year. Importantly, if candidates take advantage of the additional year facility, this will not be treated as an additional period in which they could have been productive – that is, although they have had more time on the clock, the expectation w ill not be higher. 2.4 Interim Review and Major Review in the Same Session The Promotions Committee is prepared to consider requests from Heads of Department for an Assistant Professor to undergo Interim Review and Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor in the same academic session. The two are separate processes. Candidates must pass Interim Review before they can be considered for Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor. 2.5 Timing of Promotions Promotions are considered annually in the Winter Term of each session. After an unsuccessful promotion attempt, there will be a period of two years before another proposal will be considered by the Promotions Committee, unless the Promotions Committee itself decides to waive this rule in its decision on a given case. There is no limit on the number of occasions on which a candidate may be put forward for promotion. When considering a promotion proposal, the Promotions Committee will not have before it information about any previous unsuccessful promotion proposal(s) from that candidate. 2.6 Major Review with Promotion to Associate Pr ofessor and Promotion to Professor in the Same Session The Promotions Committee is prepared to consider, in very exceptional circumstances, requests from Heads of Department for a post-Interim Review Assistant Professor to undergo Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor and be proposed for a promotion to Professor in the same academic session. Heads of Department should consult the VCAC at their earliest opportunity before submitting any such proposal. The two are separate processes. Candidates must pass Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor before they can be considered for promotion to Professor. 2.7 Deferral of Interim or Major Review Deferral of Interim Review The Promotions Committee is willing to consider deferral of Interim Review to a maximum of two years. A deferral of Interim Review does not change the scheduled date for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor. The following are examples of circumstances in which deferral may be agreed: \\uf0a7 Family related absence \\uf0a7 Personal circumstances which have disrupted normal duties that are not classified as an  13 automatic interruption \\uf0a7 Academic leave (for example buyout leave) \\uf0a7 A change in hours of work (for example a temporary period of part-time working or a permanent reduction in hours) \\uf0a7 Pertinent new information is likely to be forthcoming. An example of pertinent new information likely to be forthcoming is publications that are in “revise & resubmit” status, which if accepted for publication would significantly strengthen the candidate\\'s publication record. There is no presumption that an Assistant Professor will necessarily wish to request deferral if these or other circumstances arise. For example, where an Assistant Professor takes up a part-tim e appointment, the Head of Department’s recommendation and decision of the Promotions Committee will have due regard to the Assistant Professor’s hours of work. A request for deferral is for the Assistant Professor to decide in the first instance, in con sultation with their Head of Department. The Head of Department will consult with the Assistant Professor’s Mentor and the Professors within the department. A request for deferral and the decision will not reflect unfavourably on an Assistant Professor’s s tanding when a subsequent request is made to the Promotions Committee. Should the matter require further advice from Human Resources, the Department\\'s HR Partner should be contacted. The reasons for the deferral request should be set out by the Head of Department on the Request to Defer Interim or Major Review Form G/7 and submitted with the candidate’s CV completed on the CV Template G/2 for the Promotions Committee’s consideration. Requests for deferral of Interim Review should ideally be submitted in ti me for the May review meeting of the Promotions Committee in the year prior to the candidate’s scheduled Interim Review. Certain events also result in an automatic interruption (stopping of the review clock) – see Section 2.8 below. Deferral of Major Review A deferral of Interim Review does not change the scheduled date for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor. The scheduled date for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor can only be deferred for one year and only in exceptional case s where pertinent new information is likely to be forthcoming. An example of pertinent new information likely to be forthcoming is publications that are in “revise & resubmit” status, which if accepted for publication would significantly strengthen the candidate\\'s publication record. The reasons for the deferral request should be set out by the Head of Department on the Request to Defer Interim or Major Review Form G/7 and submitted together with the candidate’s CV completed on the CV Template G/2 for the Promotions Committee’s consideration. Requests for deferral of Major Review should ideally be submitted in time for the May review meeting of the Promotions Committee in the year prior to the candidate’s scheduled Major Review Certain events also result i n an automatic interruption (stopping of the review clock) – see Section 2.8 below. 2.8 Automatic Interruption and Stopping of Review ‘Clock’ Family leave ( i.e. maternity, adoption and shared parental leave) for an absence of 16 weeks or longer constitutes an automatic interruption (stopping of the clock) to an Assistant Professor\\'s Interim and Major Review schedule. The timetable towards Interim and Major Review will be extended (pushed back) by one year to take account of leave of this nature. Incapacity due to certificated long term illness or disability will be reviewed on a case by case basis and may also be designated as an automatic interruption, with the academic staff member\\'s Review schedule updated accordingly. In these circumstances, both the Head of Department and the individual staff member are encouraged to be in contact with their HR  14 Partner in the first instance at their earliest opportunity. Appropriate support (including reasonable adjustments where relevant) should first have been considered and implemented before a decision is taken to stop the review clock. Heads of Department are not required to request deferral of Interim Review and/or Major Review on grounds of leave of this kind. Once Human Resources has been informed of an academic staff member\\'s intention to take family leave in accordance with the above, their Review schedule will be updated accordingly unless a member of staff specifically requests that the session date for their Interim Review and/or Major Review should remain as under the original timescale. Following notification that a member of staff will be taking family leave, Human Resources will inform the member of staff of the provision for extension and ascertain their w ishes regarding the session date for Interim and/or Major Review. Human Resources will inform the candidate’s Head of Department of any proposed change to the timing of Interim or Major Review following the candidate\\'s response. Incapacity due to certificated long term illness or disability will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis and will follow the same procedure as family leave above. A one-year interruption in progress towards Interim or Major Review on grounds of leave of this kind will not preclude H eads of Department from submitting a request for deferral of Interim or Major Review on other grounds in a subsequent year, should that be considered necessary. Likewise, it does not prevent candidates from being put forward for Interim or Major Review before their newly scheduled review time. 2.9 Additional Research Leave Academic staff who are employed under the terms and conditions of the New Academic Career are entitled to a period of additional research leave following long-term absence from the School in a number of specific circumstances. The purpose of this additional research leave is for these Staff members to re-establish their research trajectory following a long period of absence. Research leave mirrors sabbatical leave in character, i.e. staff members will be relieved of their teaching and administrative duties, but differs in both its operation and the circumstances in which it can be taken. These academic staff are not required to have accrued service in order to access this provision. However, whilst research leave is an automatic entitlement, it is not mandatory. Heads of Department are expected to facilitate periods of leave under this provision for those academic staff who qualify. Additional research leave wi ll apply in the following circumstances: Type of Absence Leave Entitlement Maternity or adoption leave for a total period of sixteen weeks or greater One term Shared Parental Leave for a period of sixteen weeks or greater One term Long -term sickness absence Determined on a case -by-case basis as part of an individual’s return to work plan by the Head of Department, with HR Partner advice (up to one term). Absences of less than sixteen weeks in total will not normally attract additional research leave. Where a staff member has a long -term period of absence that falls outside one of these categories, their Head of Department can make a discretionary case for additional research leave to the Vice President and Pro -Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development). The decision of the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) is final and there is no right of appeal. As the purpose of research leave is to re-establish a faculty member’s research trajectory, research leave must normally be taken within one year of the employee returning to work. 15 Research leave not taken during this timeframe will be lost, unles s the Head of Department and Vice Pres ident and Pro-Vice Chancellor (F aculty Development) approve an alternative arrangement in the individual case. Should a staff member l eave the School befo re having taken any r esearch leave they ar e entitled to, there will be no payment in lieu of untaken leave. Academic staff members who are taking a planned period of family leave should discuss and agree the timing of their research leave with their Head of Department before they embark upon their planned family leave. Heads of Department may be willing to allow for later agreement, but this is at their discretion. Whilst academic staff do not need to ‘make a case’ for taking this type of research leave, it is implicit within this leave type that staff on research leave will be primarily focusing upon their research activities. As such, the leave should not be taken to enable the staff member to take up teaching, or other remunerated activity, at an alternative institution or establishment. Equally, it is not expected that staff w ill us e this l eave as a substitution for other c hildcare arrangements. The additional research leave will normally commence on the first day of term for the full term allowance. Heads of Department can, as a matter of discretion, choose to vary this requirement should the operational needs of the Department permit this, e.g. to enable research leave to be taken immediately following family leave. Academic staff do not need to submit a formal application for additional research leave, but leave should be agreed in advance with the Head of Department. The Head of Department and the academic staff member should notify the Human Resources Division, via their HR Partner, of the arrangement that they have agreed. HR Partners are also available for advice at an earlier stage of the process where this is needed. It is generally expected that colleagues will cover the duties of staff on research leave, but it is accepted that the expertise of the member of staff on leave will not necessarily be replicated within the Department and that, in these cases, replacement teaching expertise may need to be bought in. 2.10 Out-of-phase Retention Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor or Promotion to Professor Cases The P romotions Committee is aware of the pressures created when urgent retention issues arise and seeks to work with Heads of Department to deal with such matters expeditiously, without threatening the integrity and quality of the School’s established proc edures. The emergency Major Review and promotion procedures are dealt with in detail in Section 8.5 –Emergency Procedures. 16 3. CRITERIA FOR REVIEW AND PROMOTION 3.1 Aim of Interim Review The aim of the Interim Review is to assess the Assistant Professor’s progress during the early part of their appointment; to confirm whether they are making good progress in a direction that will lead to a successful Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor, and to ensure that they are receiving appropriate career development support from the Department. The Interim Review is designed to enable the Promotions Committee to evaluate the candidate’s promise and early achievements in research and publications, the viability of their future research and publication trajectory, their commitment to quality (including innovation as appropriate) and success in teaching and student support, and the contribution to citizenship/service of their Department and the School. Note that new recruits with appropriate teaching experience and a record of publications may be appointed post-Interim Review. 3.2 Criteria for Interim Review In considering Interim Reviews the Promotions Committee will evaluate the candidate’s activities with respect to research and publications, teaching, and contributions to the Department. The criter ia for Interim Review under the New Academic Career structure are as follows: \\uf0a7 Evidence of an emerging research programme with publication of research including articles in peer reviewed journals and/or books that is, at least, internationally excellent in terms of originality, significance and rigour. \\uf0a7 Publication of research including articles in peer reviewed journals and/or books. Candidates should normally present two research publications, though this is not a binding requirement. \\uf0a7 A coherent and feasible plan for future work towards Major Review \\uf0a7 Evidence of high-quality teaching \\uf0a7 Successful completion of the PGCertHE Full Fellowship programme or an equivalent qualification \\uf0a7 Evidence of constructive contributions to the life of the Department The Promotions Committee will base its decision on the following: \\uf0a7 A CV presented on the s tandard template including (i) a detailed and self-evaluative statement on the candidate’s contributions to education, (ii) a detailed statement of the candidate’s research and publication achievements and plans, including an approximate schedule for compl etion of projects, any planned grant applications, projected publication outlets, and proposals for dissemination, and (iii) a statement from the candidate on their contribution s to citizenship within the Department and across the School \\uf0a7 A statement from the candidate’s Head of Department reporting on the candidate’s progress in research, teaching and contributions to the Department. Departments should inform the Promotions Committee about the typical lag between submission, review, and publication in the field’s journals, the relative importance of b ooks and journal articles, and relevant aspects of recruitment procedures, in order to allow judgement on an appropriate combination of published works and evaluation of evidence of the research trajectory and quality. The statement from the candidate’s Head of Department should also comment on the operation of the Career Development Review (CDR) process \\uf0a7 School student teaching survey results \\uf0a7 For Assistant Professors appointed from 2017 onwards: A Report from an Internal Reader (normally a member of the Promotions Committee) and comments of a Monitor (also normally a Committee member) on the pieces of work nominated by the candidate and submitted to Human Resources. The Committee may also seek such other evidence as it deems appropriate.  17 3.3 Failure at Interim Review If a candidate is put forward for Interim Review before their scheduled Interim Review date (as stated in their letter of appointment unless this date became automatically postponed or deferred – see Sections 2.7 and 2.8) and the Promotions Committee is not willing to pass the candidate, the Committee will neither pass nor fail the candidate but rule that the application is premature and should be resubmitted in a future round (but in any case no later than the scheduled Interim Review date). In all other cases, should a member of staff fail to meet the requirements of Interim Review, the process following the Promotions Committee\\'s decision is discussed in Section 9.4 – Procedure following Failure at Interim or Major Review. 3.4 Aim of Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor The Promotions Committee conducts a Major Review when the Assistant Professor is to be considered for a permanent appointment with promotion to the role of Associate Professor. The procedure is designed to evaluate the ext ent of the Assistant Professor\\'s success and promise in research and scholarship, their academic merit and professional standing generally, the extent of their commitment and success in teaching, and the extent to which they have made a contribution to the work of the Department and the School. Under Promotions Committee procedures, there is no self -sponsored route for Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor. 3.5 Criteria for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor (and Promotion to Associate Professor for post -Major Review Lecturers and Assistant Professors) Success at Major Review under the New Academic Career structure will lead to promotion to Associate Professor. Post-Major Review Lecturers who may or may not have opted into the New Academic Career (upon which they became post-Major Review Assistant Profes sors) can be put forward for promotion to Associate Professor. Should they fail to secure d epartmental support, such candidates can also put themselves forward for a self- sponsored promotion to Associate Professor. The criteria for Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor and promotion to Associate Professor for post-Major Review Lecturers / Assistant Professors are the same but the latter do not undergo Major Review again. There is no promotion route under the old career structure. Departmental nominations for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor can be made as soon or as late as may be required for a Department to form a judgement on the quality of a candidate’s work and broader contributions to the School. Normally this will be within eight years of the appointment date (see Section 2.2), although this date can become automatically postponed under certain circumstances (see Section 2.8 ). In addition, exceptionally a deferral of a maximum of one year can be requested where pertinent new information is likely to be forthcoming (see Section 2.7 ). The criteria for Major Review under the New Academic Career structure/promotion to Associate Professor are as follows: Research productivity and excellence. A candidate should demonstrate intellectual originality, a high level of productivity in work of significant interest, and valuable contributions to research-based knowledge. This will normally be evidenced by: \\uf0a7 Publication of research including articles in peer reviewed journals and/or books that is, at least, internationally excellent in terms of originality, significance and rigour. Candidates should normally present four research publications, though this is not a binding requirement and overall quality is more important than quantity \\uf0a7 Indicators of influence in the candidate’s scholarly field, for example reviews and citations \\uf0a7 A coherent and viable programme of future research and intellectual contributions \\uf0a7 Supportive external assessments by competent experts 18 \\uf0a7A detailed and convincing written research statement showing the intellectual agenda guiding the candidate’s work, its likely importance to her or his field and/or the public, andits future potential It may also be evidenced by: \\uf0a7S uccess in obtaining external research funds, especially in peer -reviewed processes \\uf0a7Research impacts and/or success in bringing research-based knowledge to broaderpublics \\uf0a7Contributions to School Research Centres or Institutes (where appropriate) The P romotions Committee does not require evidence of successful grant applications for prom otion, but it does recognise that applying for research grants involves an additional peer - review process, and that, where funding is necessary in order to gather data, publications may take longer to produce. S trong and very high quality teaching. A candidate should demonstrate success in the classroom and advising, and a commitment to the education of LSE students. This will normally be evidenced by: \\uf0a7A record of high quality teaching as evaluated by students and colleagues \\uf0a7Demonstrated ability to contribute in important ways to LSE programmes, ideally at undergraduate, postgraduate, and research student levels \\uf0a7Demonstrated willingness to work to improve teaching \\uf0a7Contributions to course design and development \\uf0a7Successful completion of the PGCertHE Full Fellowship programme or an equivalent qualification (if appointed prior to 2014-15, or if appointed post-Interim Review. Although it is expected that Post-Major Review Lecturers being considered for promoti on to A ssociate Professor who passed their Major Review prior to 2014-15 have successfully completed the PGCertHE Full Fellowship programme or an equivalent qualification, it is not a requirement) \\uf0a7A statement of how the candidate approaches teaching, how they aim to do the best for LSE students, what they consider strengths and weaknesses and how they propose to improve on the weaknesses C ontributions to departmental and/or School governance and administration. These may be evidenced by: \\uf0a7S ervice in departmental administration, including course administration \\uf0a7Service to interdisciplinary programmes, Institutes, or Centres \\uf0a7Service on School -wide committees or in other governance roles \\uf0a7Contributions to other School projects and agendas such as public engagement The P romotions Committee bases its decision on its view of the evidence presented in the following documentation on template forms available from Human Resources: \\uf0a7A CV presented on the s tandard template including a statement from the candidate on their contributions to education, a research achievement record, a statement of planned research and a statement from the candidate on their contributions to citizenship within the Department and across the Sc hool \\uf0a7A statement from the candidate’s Head of Department reporting on the candidate’s progress in research, teaching and contributions to the Department and/or the School including comments on teac hing observ ation c arried out by the Head of Department or their nominee. The statement from the candidate’s Head of Department should also comment on the operation of the Career Development Review (CDR) proc ess \\uf0a7Eden Centre Teac hing Observation Report, if deemed a requirement by the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development), the Vic e President and Pro- Vice Chancellor (Education) and the VCAC \\uf0a7School student survey results \\uf0a7A Report from an Internal Reader (normally a member of the Promotions Committee) and comments of a Monitor (als o normally a Committee member) on the pieces of work  19 nominated by the candidate and submitted to Human Resources \\uf0a7 Evidence from external peer review Citation Evidence in Major Review cases: The Promotions Committee will accept citation evidence in subject areas where this is a useful measure of research quality. The availability of such evidence will be taken into account by the Promotions Committee in the promotions process but it will not be a determining factor in promotion. The Promotions Committee will be made aware that citation records can suffer from gender and other biases. Candidates are permitted to provide their ci tation count and encouraged to put this into context. Where candidates provide their citation count, Heads of Department are expected to comment on the citation count and its context (e.g., average citation counts in a field of study, the candidate’s academic age). If citation evidence is provided, three sets of citation counts -- Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science (formerly Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)) counts -- must be provided. The Library can assist candidates in putting their citation counts together (please contact Paul Flannery, Research Information Analyst at Library.Bibliometrics@lse.ac.uk ). The Committee may also seek such other evidence as it deems appropriate. 3.6 Failure at Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor If a candidate is put forward for Major Review before their scheduled Major Review date (as stated in their letter of appointment or, for those who were appointed under the old career structure, as specified in their letter confirming their opt-in to the N ew Academic Career structure, unless this date became automatically postponed or deferred – see Sections 2.7 and 2.8 ), and the Promotions Committee is not willing to pass the candidate, the Committee will neither pass nor fail the candidate but rule that the application is premature and should be resubmitted in a future round (but in any case no later than their scheduled Major Review date). In all other cases, should a member of staff fail to meet the requirements of Major Review, the process following the Promotions Committee\\'s decision is discussed in Section 9.4 – Procedure following Failure at Interim or Major Review. 3.7 Criteria for Promotion to Professor Promotion to professorial status comes in recognition of major accomplishments in research and publications combined with excellence in teaching, including advising and mentoring, and growing participation in administration and governance. Candidates for promotion to Professor should be internationally recognised leaders in their fields. Their research should be influential and known not only in their specialty area but more widely in their discipline or interdisciplinary area. In addition to research leadership, candidates will show strong contributions to teaching. Ideally these will include not only excellence in individual teaching but also leadership in teaching (for example, in mentoring more junior teachers or in course development and improvement). Weight will also be given, as appropriate to different fields, to success in entrepreneurial activities, public engagement, informing public policy, and providing service to fields of professional practice. All candidates for promotion to Professor should demonstrate significant contributions to departmental and School -wide strategic management and governance, and should show potential to contribute to the mentoring and career development of junior members of staff. The criteria for promotion are: \\uf0a7 A substantial body of published research including articles in peer reviewed journals and/or books. Candidates should present four research publications selected from their  20 publication portfolio, all of which must be published or have been accepted for publication. (For research monographs, an acceptance letter from the publisher stating it is going to publish the work at some future point is not sufficient; instead, the manuscript must be in its finished form.) All submitted items must be at least internationally excellent and two of the submitted items must be world leading in terms of originality, rigour and significance. Consistent with the School’s emphasis on quality of publications as a pre-eminent criterion, candidates may exceptionally submit fewer than four publications. In such cases, a statement of justification from the Head of Department is required. Submitted publications should, other than in exceptional circumstances, not have been used as outputs submitted for Major Review. For candidates appointed to the School post-Major Review, submitted publications should have been published after the equivalent of Major Review in their previous appointment. Invoking such exceptional circumstances requires a statement of justification from the Head of Department. \\uf0a7 An international reputation as evidenced by reviews of publications, citations, prizes and honours, and assessments by peers. \\uf0a7 A coherent and viable programme of future research and intellectual contributions. \\uf0a7 A record of successful and innovative teaching at all levels, including a track record of successful PhD supervision. \\uf0a7 Evidence of management capabilities as demonstrated by significant contributions to departmental and School administration. \\uf0a7 Contribution to the development and performance of colleagues through coaching, mentoring and peer support. The Promotions Committee will also take account of the following: \\uf0a7 Leadership in scholarly initiatives in relevant disciplinary or interdisciplinary communities \\uf0a7 – e.g. editorship of journals, membership of committees in professional associations, appointment to significant research bodies, and government/international advisory committees. \\uf0a7 A record of securing peer -reviewed research funds and where appropriate, contributions to School Research Centres \\uf0a7 Research impacts and/or success in bringing research-based knowledge to broader publics. The Promotions Committee does not require evidence of successful grant applications for promotion, but it does recognise that applying for research grants involves an additional peer - review process, and that, where funding is necessary in order to gather data, publications may take longer to produce. The Promotions Committee bases its decision on its view of the evidence presented in the following documentation on template forms available from Human Resources: \\uf0a7 A CV presented on the standard template including a statement from the candidate on their contributions to education, a research achievement record, a statement of planned research and a statement from the candidate on their contributions to citizenship within the Department and across the School \\uf0a7 A statement from the candidate’s Head of Department reporting on the candidate’s progress in research, teaching and contri butions to the Department and/or the School. \\uf0a7 The statement from the candidate’s Head of Department should also comment on the operation of the Career Development Review (CDR) process \\uf0a7 Eden Centre Teaching Observation Report, if deemed a requirement by the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development), the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Education) and the VCAC \\uf0a7 School student survey results \\uf0a7 A Report from an Internal Reader (normally a member of the Prom otions Committee) and comments of a Monitor (also normally a Committee member) on the pieces of work nominated by the candidate and submitted to Human Resources. \\uf0a7 Evidence from external peer review Citation Evidence in Promotion cases:  21 The Promotions Commi ttee will accept citation evidence in subject areas where this is a useful measure of research quality. The availability of such evidence will be taken into account by the Promotions Committee in the promotions process but it will not be a determining factor in promotion. The Promotions Committee will be made aware that citation records can suffer from gender and other biases. Candidates are permitted to provide their citation count and encouraged to put this into context. Where candidates provide their citation count, Heads of Department are expected to comment on the citation count and its context (e.g. average citation counts in a field of study, the candidate’s academic age). If citation evidence is provided, three sets of citation counts -- Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science (formerly Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)) counts -- must be provided. The Library can assist candidates in putting their citation counts together (please contact Paul Flannery, Research Information Analyst at Library.Bibliometrics@lse.ac.uk ). The Committee may also seek such other evidence as it deems appropriate. 3.8 Unsuccessful promotion proposals The process following the Promotions Committee\\'s decision is discussed in Section 9 – Decisions of the Promot ions Committee. 22 4. RO LE OF THE HEAD OF DEPARTMENT IN THE REVIEW AND PROMOTION PROCESS 4.1 Functions of the Head of Department The pr incipal functions of the Head of Department in relation to Interim Review and Major Review and promotion of academic staff are: C areer Development of all non-Professorial Academic Staff \\uf0a7To ensure that all non- Professorial academic staff, and particularly those coming up for review and promotion, receive constructive advice on career development, and that the Academic Staff Career Development Review (CDR) Scheme (available on the Human Resources website ) operates effectively at department level, including the nominati on of senior members of academic staff to conduct academic career development review meetings (CDR Meetings), where not undertaken by the Head of Department, and ens uring that CDR Meetings are conducted where appropriate. A ssistant Professors \\uf0a7To ensure that Assistant Professors receive appropriate career development advice and support from senior members of academic staff; \\uf0a7To appoint Departmental Mentors for Assistant Professors; \\uf0a7To keep under review with departmental Professorial colleagues the progress of Assista nt P rofessors towards Interim Review and Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor and to be responsible for the submission of proposals for Interim \\uf0a7Review and Major Review to the Promotions Committee; P romotion of Academic Staff \\uf0a7To keep under review with departmental p rofessorial colleagues the possible claims to promotion of all Associate Professors and, where relevant, post-Major Review Lecturers or Assistant Professors and to be responsible for the presentation and submission ofdepartment promotion proposals to the Promotions Committee. Ther e is an annual timetable governing submission of proposals for Interim Review and Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor, and promotion to (full) Professor in Annex C to these Guidelines. All proposals are assessed by the Promotions Committee. A reference guide to the Review deadlines and documentation required can be found at Annex D. The C riteria for Interim Review and Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor, and promotion to Professor, can be found at Section 3 and the process is dealt with in detail in Section 9 – Procedures. Template forms, along with a full copy of this Guidance, can also be found on the Human Resources website. 4.2 Administrative workload of pre-Interim Review Assistant Professors H eads of Department are reminded of the Promotions Committee’s expectation that, normally, pre-Interim Review Assistant Professors should not be asked to carry heavy administrative workloads. 4.3 Research Student Supervision of Assistant Professors H eads of Department are reminded that the School’s Regulations for Research Degrees states that the Departmental Doctoral Programme Director has responsibility for ensuring that pre- Major Review members of staff do not have lead supervisory responsibility for research students. 4.4 Responsibility for Submission of the Case to the Promotions Committee H eads of Department are responsible for the electronic submission of all documentation listed in Sections 4.2, 4.5 and 4.7 concerning Review and departmentally -sponsored  23 Promotion proposals to the Promotions Committee via Human Resources, except the Eden Centre Teaching Report where relevant. It follows that Heads of Department are expected to take an active role in advising candidates on presentation of their CVs on the C V Template G/2, ensuring that information is set out clearly and that there are no omissions. Heads of Department are also expected to sign off on these forms. Documentation submitted directly to Human Resources by candidates will not be accepted (unless for self-sponsored promotion cases). A reference guide to the deadlines and documentation required can be found at Annex D, the Criteria for Interim and Major Review, and promotion to Professor, can be found at Section 3 and the process is dealt w ith in detail in Section9. Template forms, along with a full copy of this Guidance, can also be found on the Human Resources website. Documentation for the Promotion and Review process (including writings) should be electronically submitted to Human Resources. Should this be impossible please contact Human Resources in good time to arrange an alternative. 4.5 Departmental Support for Review and Promotion Candidates: Views of the Departmental Professoriate Departments are strongly encouraged to issue guidelines to their Assistant Professors and Associate Professors regarding the timing, process and criteria by which the Department’s Professoriate decides on whether to provide d epartmental support for review and promotion candidates. Such guidelines require the approval by the VCAC and the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this document and the d epartmental guidance, this document should be regarded as definitive. The Head of Department must have consulted professorial colleagues regarding the candidate, and the Head of Department\\'s Statement should be based on the information submitted to and considered by the department’s Professoriate. The Head of Department\\'s Statement G/1 should make clear which members of the department’s Professoriate (e.g. Professors on leave) were involved in the discussion leading to the decision to recommend the Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor, promotion to Associate Professor (post- Major Review Lecturers / Assistant Professors only) or promotion to Professor. The Committee expects that a decision will be taken on the basis of a vote by all serving Professors, and that the Head of Department\\'s Statement G/1 will indicate the numbers voting for and against as well as those abstaining. A candidate cannot normally be put forward for Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor before their normally scheduled Major Review in accordan ce with Section 2.2 unless they have majority support of those voting. The Promotions Committee does not regard unanimity of the departmental Professoriate as a sine qua non of a successful case, but does expect that if there are differing opinions these w ill be explained in full in the Head of Department\\'s Statement G/1. Departments may solicit external references to inform their decision on whether to support a candidate for Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor and/or a candidate for promotion to Professor. Where Departments do so, the following rules apply: \\uf0a7 The list of referees needs to be approved by the VCAC who will apply the same criteria as listed in Section 8.2 Criteria for Selection of External Referees. \\uf0a7 Candidates should be invited to nominate up to 50 per cent of the referees. \\uf0a7 The soliciting letter/email needs to be approved by the VCAC. To maximise the usefulness of references, referees should be sent the writings that would be submitted to the School’s Promotions Committee and ask referees to comment in detail on the quality of these writings. \\uf0a7 All soliciting emails should be copied to Human Resources and all references received must be made available to the VCAC and Human Resources.  24 \\uf0a7 Where the case does not receive departmental support, the VCAC will check that the candidate has been treated fairly. \\uf0a7 Where the case comes to the Promotions Committee for decision, all reference letters solicited by the Department will be made available to the Promotions Committee. \\uf0a7 Where the case comes to the Promotions Committee for decision, the VCAC has the right to allow the reference letters solicited by the Department to substitute for some or all of the reference letters that would otherwise be solicited by the Promotions \\uf0a7 Committee. 4.6 Head of Department’s Role in Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor Heads of Department are asked to give as much information as possible to Major Review candidates about the timetable and the procedures to be followed, and to emphasise that the Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor is not a competitive exercise but an assessment of whether an individual meets the standards set by the School for a permanent appointment. In all but the most exceptional cases, Heads of Department are expected to be sufficiently au fait with the work of their junior colleagues that they are able to defend Major Review candidates if called upon to do so by the Promotions Committee. 4.7 Head of Department’s Statement Interim Review The Head of Department\\'s Statement G/1 on candidates for Interim Review is the most important piece of evidence considered by the Promotions Committee. The statement should provide an evaluative commentary on the candidate’s academic profile, with particular emphasis on teaching, research and publication strategy, contributions to departmental administration and any other relevant professional activities. The statement should look forward to the Major Review commenting on the candidate’s planned trajectory to m eet the criteria for a successful Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor. Departments should inform the Promotions Committee about the typical lag between submission, review, and publication in the field’s journals, the relative importance of books and journal articles, and relevant aspects of recruitment procedures, in order to allow judgement on an appropriate combination of published works and evaluation of evidence of the research trajectory and quality. The statement should also confirm that Academic Staff Career Development Review (CDR) meetings have taken place and outline the career development advice provided to the candidate and any relevant issues raised in the meetings. See Section 1.12 on the Scheme for Academic Career Development R eview and Mentoring, or the Human Resources website, for more information. The Promotions Committee would expect that should the Head of Department have any serious concerns regarding the Assistant Professor’s prospects for a successful Interim Review, the Head of Department would have sought the advice of the VCAC and, if appropriate, an HR Partner at an earlier stage. Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor The Promotions Committee views the Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor as one of the most important decisions for the School. The evidence in the Head of Department’s Statement G/1 is of particular weight. The Promotions Committee would expect that should the Head of Department have any serious concerns regarding the Assistant Professor’s prospects for a successful Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor, the Head of Department would have sought the advice of the VCAC and, if appropriate, an HR Partner at an earlier stage. If candidates are nominated before the maximum time limit specified in their appointment letter, Heads of Department should make the case that the candidate is ready to undergo Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor. Heads of Department are encouraged to seek  25 guidance from the VCAC. Promotion to Associate Professor (post-Major Review Lecturers / Assistant Professors only) and Promotion to Professor The Promotions Committee expects Heads of Department to frame their statements with the relevant respective promotion criteria in mind. 4.8 Content of the Head of Department\\'s Statement for Major Review and Promotion The Promotions Committee expects Heads of Department to address the following areas in their reports on candidates: 1. Academic Profile: A full evaluative commentary on the candidate\\'s academic profile, across the range of research, teaching, administration and other professional activities, as evidenced by the curriculum vitae, ensuring detail is provided to inform the Promotions Committee’s decision. 2. Research Productivity and Excellence: The Head of Department should indicate their opinion of the quality of the candidate\\'s research, published outputs, and future trajectory - including, where appropriate, the candidate\\'s success in publishing in the top journals or with the top presses in the field. Heads of Department should indicate any issues where journal lead-times may be a factor affecting the quantity of published output. The Head of Department is expected to comment in detail on the quality of each of the publications submitted to the Promotions Committee. Where possible, they should comment specifically on the originality of the candidate’s intellectual contribution (noting that this may be especially important in cases where work i s co-authored and the individual contribution of the candidate may not be obvious to readers). The Head of Department should outline the departmental view on the assessment of research quality including, where appropriate: \\uf0a7 Prestige publishing outlets which may include the titles of the top journals and top presses in the field \\uf0a7 The relative weighting, if any, given to articles over books or vice-versa \\uf0a7 Whether co-authorship is the norm within the field, and comment on any joint -authored work submitted \\uf0a7 Clarifying the significance of conference contributions in the candidate’s field \\uf0a7 Whether a PhD is sine qua non \\uf0a7 A definition of what is regarded as international standing in the candidate\\'s discipline. The Promotions Committee rec ognises that variations exist and it will not be seeking to compare approaches across disciplines. The Promotions Committee may use the Departmental Journal Lists and Publishing Norms documents, which are submitted to the Promotions Committee at its first meeting of the session, to inform its decision-making and evaluation of candidates. Citation Evidence: The Promotions Committee will accept citation evidence in subject areas where this is a useful measure of research quality. The availability of su ch evidence will be taken into account by the Promotions Committee in the promotions process but it will not be a determining factor in promotion. The Promotions Committee will be made aware that citation records can suffer from gender and other biases. Candidates are permitted to provide their citation count and encouraged to put this into context. Where candidates provide their citation count, Heads of Department are expected to comment on the citation count and its context (e.g., average citation counts in a field of study, the candidate’s academic age). 3. Teaching Quality: The Head of Department should provide a detailed and comprehensive account of the candidate\\'s overall teaching profile including:  26 \\uf0a7 Volume of teaching: including an indication of the candidate\\'s role on each course and the student numbers. \\uf0a7 Breadth of teaching: whether the candidate\\'s teaching is all related to their area of research or whether they are required to teach a broader range of subject matter. \\uf0a7 Evidence of teaching performanc e: feedback from students, including responses to the School survey, and feedback from colleagues in the Eden Centre. Along with the strengths in their teaching, any weaknesses along with the steps that have been taken and are planned to address them. \\uf0a7 Other matters: any issues relating to variability of teaching scores or any other matters in the School survey data which may need explanation/interpretation. \\uf0a7 Involvement in innovation: to include innovation in terms of both curriculum content (e.g. development of new courses or key role in course revision) and delivery methods. \\uf0a7 Involvement in personal development as a teacher, and/or in the support and development of others: evidence of involvement in training, beyond the “minimum expectations” and/or mentoring, GTA support, involvement in central or departmental staff development as provider rather than participant. When referring to any teaching course, Heads of Department are requested to state the full course name and course code. Heads of Department should ensure that all relevant evidence is provided in the Contributions to Education section of the candidate\\'s CV Template G/2, and that any weaknesses are discussed fully by the candidate and the Head of Department along with the steps that have been taken and are planned to address them. The Promotions Committee will also have before it School student survey results for up to the four previous sessions but not the current session as they are not available in time. Departmental Teac hing Observations The Departmental Teaching Observation is no longer a requirement, however if it is considered beneficial for the candidate, a Head of Department may wish to carry one out. In the case that a Head of Department carries out an observation, the report should be submitted on the observation form G/6. 4. Service to the Department and the School: The Head of Department should provide their opinion of the candidate\\'s contribution to the work of the School, whether at Departmental level or in the wider School context, for example evidence of good citizenship through service on departmental/School committees or holding School offices. 5. Career Development: The Head of Department should confirm that Academic Staff Career Development Review (CDR) meetings have taken place and outline the career development advice provided to the candidate and the Department\\'s expectations for future career progression. 4.9 Responsibility for Submission of the Self-Sponsored Case for Promotion to the Promotions Committee Associate Professors wishing to propose themselves for promotion to Professor or post- Major Review Lecturers / Assistant Professors wishing to propose themselves for promotion to Associate Professor on a self-sponsored basis are strongly encouraged to discuss this with the VCAC well in advance of the relevant deadlines. They are free to submit the self-sponsored proposal through their Head of Department or directly to Human Resources. A reference guide to the deadlines and documentation required can be found at Annex D, the Criteria can be found at Section 3 and the process is dealt with in detail in Section 9. Template forms, along with a full copy of this Guidance, can also be found on the Human Resources website. In all cases, Human Resources will write to the candidate\\'s Head of Department requesting a  27 full written statement about the work of the self- sponsored candidate to be submitted by the HoD Deadline 2 as listed in Annex D. The Head of Department will be asked to state their opinion of the quality of the research and published output and to set out clearly and unambiguously the full range of opinions amongst the d epartmental professoriate. If the self- sponsored proposal is submitted through the Head of Department, the Head of Department is free to submit their statement on the work of the candidate with the promotion documentation. 4.10 Self-Sponsored Candidate\\'s Statement The Pr omotions Committee expects self-sponsored candidates to frame their reports with the criteria for promotion to Associate Professor (post-Major Review Lecturers / Assistant Professors only) or promotion to Professor in mind. 26 5 CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCAT ION 5.1 Self-evaluative commentary on C ontributions to Education Candidates should keep in mind that the Promotions Committee puts much emphasis on a detailed and self-evaluative Contribution to E ducation statement submitted by candidates and supporting evidence as an addendum to the CV Template G/2. This addendum to the CV template should be between 2, 000 and 2,200 words ; additional evidence can be placed in an appendix. The commentary is attached to the CV as a separate educational contribution statement. Candidates should present a case for how they ful fil the criteria for the relevant review or promotion stage they are considered for. The criteria potentially relating to educational contribution and performance are as follows: Interim Review \\uf0a7 Evidence of high-quality teaching \\uf0a7 Successful completion of the PGCertHE Full Fellowship programme or an equivalent qualification Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor \\uf0a7 A record of high quality teaching as evaluated by students and colleagues \\uf0a7 Successful completion of the PGCertHE Full Fellowship programme or an equivalent qualification (if appointed in 2014-15 or later) \\uf0a7 Demonstrated ability to contribute in important ways to LSE programmes, ideally at undergraduate, postgraduate, and research student levels \\uf0a7 Demonstrated willingness to work to improve teaching \\uf0a7 Contributions to course design and development Promotion to Pr ofessor \\uf0a7 A record of successful and innovative teaching at all levels, including a track record of successful PhD supervision. \\uf0a7 Evidence of management capabilities as demonstrated by significant contributions to departmental and School administration. \\uf0a7 Contri bution to the development and performance of colleagues through coaching, mentoring and peer support. In order to address the criteria directly, candidates may wish to refer to and address some of the following in writing their statement (note that some of these will inevitably be more relevant for candidates for promotion to Professor who are further along in their career): \\uf0a7 Their approach to teaching, learning and assessment \\uf0a7 Evidence of engagement with student diversity and discussion of notable successes and/or challenges in terms of teaching \\uf0a7 Evidence of use of Moodle or other e -learning tools and other approaches that address diversity in teaching delivery \\uf0a7 Diversity of teaching and learning approaches used by the individual and extent to which they intr oduce new ideas \\uf0a7 Use of teaching development funding from the Eden Centre/LTI/other + evidence of evaluation and decision regarding next steps \\uf0a7 Evidence of dissemination related to teaching (e.g. blog/article/report/Teaching Symposium contribution) \\uf0a7 Their involvement in course and curriculum development \\uf0a7 Evidence of leadership role – e.g. in course, programme, examinations, student selection, tutoring, work with GTAs, colleague mentoring, external programmes, committee contributions  27 \\uf0a7 Feedback from GTAs/others working with the individual \\uf0a7 Evidence of LSE education prizes (e.g., Major Review Excellence in Education P rize, SU nomination; department and disciplinary awards) or non-LSE teaching-related prizes/commendations \\uf0a7 External grant funding for teaching development – with evidence of outcomes arising \\uf0a7 Conference presentations/journal articles related to pedagogy \\uf0a7 Lead author/editor of textbook \\uf0a7 Evidence of engagement in personal/professional development in relation to teaching \\uf0a7 Evidence of external recognition e.g. external examining; visiting lecturing; membership of review panels in other univer sities \\uf0a7 Leadership/advisory roles on national/international HE teaching developments discipline/national teaching-related prizes/commendations \\uf0a7 For candidates for promotion to Professor only: Track record of mentoring others (possibly including references fr om staff who have been mentored by the individual) and PhD supervision record in terms of students supervised, completion rates and achievement in terms of prizes and placements. \\uf0a7 Any additional circumstances that they would like the Promotions Committee to be aware of, including a disability or other condition that may have impacted on their teaching and/or education contributions (see Section 1.6 – Optional Declaration of Individual Circumstances). Candidates are advised to refer to a range of evidence to substantiate the claims made in the Statement. Candidates are invited to add an appendix with additional documents to substantiate claims made in the commentary. The appendix is intended to be concise, and the Promotions Committee’s expectation is that items will be immediately relevant and brief, such as an enhanced course guide. Candidates should note that the Promotions Committee already has access to TQARO student survey results, as well as Departmental and Eden Centre observation reports. The Promotions Committee is aware of the limitations of using TQARO student survey results as a means of evaluating contributions to education. The Committee seeks to evaluate teaching and wider contributions to education in a holistic way and TQARO student survey results form only one part of the evidence base relating to contributions to education. The Promotions Committee reserves the right to approach the candidate\\'s Head of Department to request that any evidence of poor teaching should be addressed. The VCAC is responsible for follow -up actions on behalf of the Promotions Committee regarding any issues of concern identified by the Committee in relation to the teaching performance of individual members of staff. 5.2 Teaching Observations Departmental Teaching Observation A Departmental Teaching Observation is no longer a requirement for review and promotion candidates, however, should it be considered beneficial for a candidate, a Head of Department may wish to carry out an observation. In the case that a Departmental Teaching Observation is carried out, the Departmental Teaching Observation Form G/6 form should contain an evaluative commentary of the candidate’s teaching as observed by the Head of Department or their delegate. Eden Centre Teaching Observation Human Resources is responsible for notifying the Eden Centre of the schedule of Major Reviews, Promotions and Self-Sponsored Promotions each session and will liaise with the  28 Eden Centre in order to arrange the submission of reports. However, the Eden Centre will only conduct Teaching Observations where there are concerns about a candidate’s teaching scores and when the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development), Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor) (Education) and the VCAC deem it to be a requirement. In the case where a Teaching Observation is considered necessary, the Eden Centre observer should arrange a short meeting or make contact by email with the teacher before the session to ascertain and clarify the objectives for the session and obtain background on the student group. The observer and teacher should review the Teaching Observation form together and note particular areas of observation to be highlighted. The observer should also ask the teacher whether there is any particular aspect they would like feedback on. The observer should arrange a debrief with the teacher after the session. It will be expected that the observer will let the teacher see the feedback before it is submitted to Human Resources on the Teaching Observation form. The teacher will be free to append any additional r elevant comments. Advice should be sought from the Eden Centre in cases where the teaching observation raises any issues of concern or where further support may be required - for example, training/coaching/other forms of support. Where appropriate, the Head of Department may request that a further teaching observation be conducted by the Eden Centre. It is expected that departments will be proactive in seeking advice from the Eden Centre in this regard. Recommendations for any follow -up action - including training/coaching/other forms of support should be recorded on the Teaching Observation form. 5.3 LSE Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Requirement for New Assistant Professors All new career -track staff appointed from the 2009-10 session to the 2010-11 session with fewer than three years’ higher education teaching experience and who have not completed an equivalent programme elsewhere in the UK are expected to undertake and complete the Full Fellowship level of the LSE Postgraduate Certi ficate in Higher Education (PGCertHE). All new career -track staff appointed from the 2011-12 session to the 2013-14 session with less than three years\\' teaching experience and who have not completed and passed an equivalent programme elsewhere in the UK are expected to undertake, complete and pass the Full Fellowship level of the LSE Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCertHE) prior to being considered for Major Review. All new career -track staff appointed from the 2014 -15 session onwards who are contractually required to undertake, complete and pass the Full Fellowship level of the LSE PGCertHE must do so prior to being considered for Interim Review. All new career -track staff appointed post-Interim Review from the 2014-15 session onwards are required to undertake, complete and pass the Full Fellowship level of the LSE PGCertHE prior to being considered for Major Review. For further information, see the PGCertHE website. 26 6 CONTRIBUTIONS TO CITIZENSHIP 6.1 Self-evaluative commentary on Contributions to Citizenship Candidates should keep in mind that the Promotions Committee puts much emphasis on a detailed and self-evaluative Contribution to Citizenship statement submitted by candidates and supporting evidence as an addendum to the CV Template G/2. This addendum to the CV template relevant section of the CV template should be no more than 2 pages for candidates for Interim Review and Major Review, and no more than 4 pages for candidates for Promotion to Professor; additional evidence can be placed in an appendix. The commentary is attached to the CV as a separate citizenship contribution statement. All staff are expected to fulfil the expectations of their roles, such as being an available and supportive academic mentor (including replying to student emails in a timely manner and writing references); attending and taking part in departmental meetings; and meeting all departmental deadlines, for example for the submission of CVs and CDR forms. Academic citizenship also involves participating actively in the smooth running of the School, at departmental and at School level, in addition to making a contribution to one’s discipline and to society. Being a good academic citizen is about how someone works as well as what they do. All academic staff are expected to uphold t he School ’s values and its commitment to ensuring that the School is a truly inclusive university. Active academic citizenship within the School typically encompasses the following activities across the course of one’s career: \\uf0a7 Actively contributing to the development and realisation of the strategic goals of the department and the School. \\uf0a7 Taking on leadership and management roles appropriate to an individual’s position and doing them well. \\uf0a7 Taking on departmental and School administrative roles appropriate to an individual’s position and doing them well. \\uf0a7 Volunteering to sit on department and School committees and working groups and making a positive contribution to them. \\uf0a7 Mentoring less experienced colleagues. \\uf0a7 Covering for colleagues when necessary. \\uf0a7 Attending and taking part in departmental Seminars, PhD seminars and PhD upgrade events. \\uf0a7 Attending and taking part in widening participation activities, open days, welcoming activities, student events, graduation ceremonies and alumni events. \\uf0a7 Playing an ac tive role in staff recruitment by serving on appointment panels and attending job talks. \\uf0a7 Promoting equity, diversity and inclusion in all aspects of one’s role at the School \\uf0a7 For Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor, there must be evidence of sustained academic citizenship which demonstrates that the person has contributed actively to departmental administration and to School -wide activities. \\uf0a7 For promotion to full Professor, there must be evidence of sustained academic citizenship w hich demonstrates that the person has made significant contributions to departmental and School -wide strategic management and governance. Outside of LSE, staff are expected to take on citizenship roles appropriate to their level of seniority within the academy, such as engaging with external funding bodies, taking on journal editorship roles, and serving as a peer -reviewer and referee.  27 7 CANDIDATES’ SUBMITTED WRITINGS IN SUPPORT OF CASE 7.1 Work cited on the CV Candidates should note that the Promotions Committee reserves the right to request copies of any work cited on the CV Template G/2. It follows that all work should be available, preferably in electronic form, in case the Promotions Committee should request it. The dated electronic signatures of the candidate and Head of Department on the electronic version of the CV Template G/2 are required as confirmation that the information provided is accurate. 7.2 Work cited on the CV for Interim Review For thos e Assistant Professors appointed before 2017, there is no requirement for the submission of writings in support of Interim Review. For those Assistant Professors appointed from 2017 onwards, candidates should normally present two research publications, though this is not a binding requirement and overall quality is more important than quantity. 7.3 Work submitted for Major Review or Promotion In addition to the criteria for Major Review or Promotion ( Sections 3.5 and 3.7, respectively) relating to writings, as the Promotions Committee will consider the quality of writings of Major Review and Promotion candidates the following should also be noted. A central part of the Promotions Committee’s process is that written work submitted with a review and/or promotions case will be read and commented on in detail; Referees are also asked to read and comment in detail on the submitted writings. As a consequence, very careful consideration should be given by candidates to the selection of writings and it is strongly recommended that they should seek advice from senior colleagues about this selection. For promotion to Professor cases, the submitted writings should, other than in exceptional cases, not have been used as outputs submitted for Major Review. Invoki ng such exceptional circumstances requires a statement of justification from the Head of Department. It follows that any writing submitted in support of a candidate’s case for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor is ineligible for submission in support of a candidate’s case for Promotion to Professor. For candidates appointed to the School post-Major Review, submitted publications should have been published after the equivalent of Major Review in their previous appointment. In addition, all submitted items for promotion to Professor cases must be published or have been accepted for publication. For all other review and promotion cases, the expectation is that, normally, submitted pieces will be published or have been accepted for publication ( accompanied by a confirmation letter / email from the editors / book publishers). For research monographs, an acceptance letter from the publisher stating it is going to publish the work at some future point is not sufficient; instead, the manuscript must be in its finished form. The candidate should normally submit to Human Resources the four writings which they believe best represent their qualities as a scholar. Careful consideration should be given to the selection of writings in support of the case. Candidates are asked to explain on their CV the rationale for selecting the writings submitted in support of Major Review and/or promotion and how the selected items relate to one another. All candidates are asked to state clearly on the CV the stage all their publications have reached – e.g. whether work submitted for publication has finally been accepted, conditionally accepted, is in revis e and resubmit status or is submitted. Evidence of acceptance (whether final or conditional) will be required in all cases – i.e. for all work on  28 the CV not just the submitted pieces. For all publications on the CV in revise and resubmit status, candidates are required to submit the editors’ confirmation email inviting the candidate to revise and resubmit the piece. Any reviews, whether favourable or not, which have appeared on any the candidate’s books, whether submitted as part of the writings or not, should also be submitted. Co-authorship Where possible, candidates should give priority to writings where they have made the leading or major contribution as candidates should recognise that the Committee is looking for evidence of a leading or major contribution across all pieces submitted. The Promotions Committee recognises that co-authorship is the norm for some disciplines and where this is the case, jointly authored work will be considered of equal standing. Candidates are required to provide a numeric al indication in percentage terms of their contribution(s) to joint work on the CV, alongside the requirement to state the respective contributions of co-authors in regard to the initiation, conduct and direction of the work. Candidates should also provide details of the proportion of intellectual contribution made to the work (e.g. indicating their involvement in the formulation of key themes, concepts and theories). The Promotions Committee reserves the right to ask co-authors for a confirmation of the respective contributions stated by promotion candidates. Multiple book chapters of the same book The Promotions Committee expects to be able to assess a range of candidates’ work. Wherever possible, the submission of multiple chapters of the same book as separate works should be avoided. Publication language The expectation is that normally publications submitted in support of Major Review and/or promotion will be written in English. In cases where a publication(s) submitted for Major Review or promotion is not written in English, the Department is responsible for translating the work into English. Where this cannot reasonably be expected, the Department should contact the VCAC at their earliest opportunity to request an exemption from this rule. If an ex emption is granted, the Department is responsible for providing a summary in English, summarising the output and outlining the research methodologies used. The Department should also suggest the name(s) of external experts able to read the work in the orig inal language. Presentation of Writings Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that: \\uf0a7 Wherever available, writings should be submitted in electronic form rather than in hard copy. \\uf0a7 Writings are properly -ordered and clearly identified for the ease of readers. \\uf0a7 Wherever possible, submitted hard copies should be photocopies of originals. \\uf0a7 Large manuscripts should be drilled and treasury -tagged and not submitted loose-leaf. For items where no electronic copy is avail able, candidates are encouraged to scan them to make them electronically available. Where this is not feasible, seven properly -ordered sets of each writing that are not available electronically, should be submitted to Human Resources, either in the form of original hard copies or photocopies of the original hard copy. All writings submitted as hard copy will be returned to the candidate by the beginning of the academic session following that in which they were submitted.  29 8 EXTERNAL PEER REVIEW The Promotions Committee solicits external peer review advice from Referees as part of its decision-making process for Major Review and promotion cases. In the interests of fairness, the Promotions Committee will not accept comments, either written or verbal from third parties; third parties being those from whom comments had not been formally solicited. It is the responsibility of the Head of Department to ensure that, prior to nomination, all Referees are willing to be contacted by the VCAC and to participate in the process. In particular, the Head of Department should notify potential Referees that they will be expected to comment specifically and in detail on each of the candidate’s submitted writings if they are asked by the VCAC to participate in the process. All Referees are thanked for their advice and are informed about successful cases for whom they served. A reference guide to the Promotion Committee’s requirements regarding the number of nominations of Referees can be found at Annex E. A reference guide to the documentation shared with Referees can be found at Annex F. 8.1 Role of External Referees in the Review and Promotions Process Referees are asked to comment specifically and in detail on each of the candidate’s submitted publications as well as their planned research as set out in the research trajectory statement. They can also comment on the general research profile of candidates. The Promotions Committee gives its referees the option to provide comparisons to academics from the same cohort in the candidate’s field. Referees are not sent the Head of Department Statement G/1. Interim Review External peer review is not normally part of the Interim Review procedure. However, if a majority of the members of the Promotions Committee are doubtful about the Head of Department’s recommendation, the Committee may ask the Head of Department to suggest the names of external R eferees for the Promotions Committee’s consideration. Where it considers it appropr iate, the Promotions Committee may canvass the views of one or more such outside R eferees. Referees for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor, Promotion to Associate Professor (post-Major Review Lecturers / Assistant Professors only) and for Promotion to Professor Heads of Department are required to provide the names of external R eferees for each candidate on the Referees for Major Review and/or Promotion Form G/4. Normally, eight names are required in total (including two reserves); four are to be nominated by the Department (including one reserve) and four by the candidate (including one reserve ). The Promotions Committee will seek references from at least four of the eight nominated external Referees. In all cases, the Promotions Committee takes the final decision about which Referees to consult and is not bound to accept referee nominations proposed by the Department or the candidate. The Promotions Committee may substitute its own suggestion(s) for those proposed by the Department or the c andidate. Referees for Self-Sponsored Promotion Self-sponsored candidates are required to provide the names of external referees on the Referees for Major Review and/or Promotion Form G/4. Normally, candidates should  30 nominate four external Referees (including one reserve); an additional four external Referees (including one reserve) are to be nominated by the VCAC. To further ensure the necessary degree of independence in the nomination of external Referees for self-sponsored cases, the VCAC will take a view on the suitability of the Referees proposed by the self- sponsored candidate and may consult the candidate\\'s Head of Department. Self-sponsored candidates will be expected to provide written justification in any case where the VCAC is of the view that the criteria of selection of external Referees (see Section 8.2) are not met. The VCAC should be approached for adv ice on individual cases.. In all cases, the Promotions Committee takes the final decision about which referees to consult and is not bound to accept names proposed by the self-sponsored candidate or the VCAC. The Promotions Committee may substitute its own suggestion(s) for those proposed by the candidate or the VCAC. Referees for Emergency Major Review and/or Promotion Heads of Department are normally required to provide the names of five departmentally - sponsored external referees (including two reserves) on the Referees for Major Review and/or Promotion Form G/4, to be consulted by the Committee. The Promotions Committee or, where this is not feasible, the VCAC takes the final decision about which R eferees to consult and is not bound to accept referee nominations proposed by Departments. Instead or in addition it can nominate its own set of R eferees. 8.2 Criteria for Selection of External Referees Heads of Department will be expected to provide written justification in any case where it is felt the below requirements cannot be met. The VCAC should be approached for advice on individual cases. \\uf0a7 All Referees should be employed by a distinguished university. \\uf0a7 For each candidate, at least one R eferee should be employed by a top tier UK University and at least one should be employed by a distinguished overseas institution. \\uf0a7 Referees should be confined to those of full Professorial (or Emeritus Professorial) status or equivalent. Heads of Department should provide written justification in any case where a Referee does not hold the title of Professor. \\uf0a7 The nomination of more than one Referee from the same Department within the same institution will not normally be permitted. \\uf0a7 Wherever appropriate R eferees should be of international standing and active in research publication in the appropriate field. \\uf0a7 Referees should not normally have been on the staff of the School in the four previous years, held a Centennial Professorship or visiting appointment at the School in the four previous years or hold a Centennial Professorship or visiting appointment currently. \\uf0a7 The naming of R eferees should not, normally, include people who have co-authored or acted as co-investigators with the candidate in the past four years. Heads of Department should seek the advice of the VCAC for disciplines where joint authorship or collaboration is the norm and where co -authors or co-investigators may be best placed to act as R eferees. \\uf0a7 The naming of Referees should not include people who have acted as a PhD supervisor to the candidate. \\uf0a7 The naming as R eferees of eminent scholars who are unfamiliar with a candidate’s work or who may not be able to provide anything other than very general comments should be avoided. \\uf0a7 There may be different aspects of a candidate\\'s work to be assessed and R eferees should be nominated with this in mind and with an indication where appropriate of which aspect(s) a referee is being asked to comment on.  31 \\uf0a7 For candidates with inter - or multi -disciplinary research interests, Heads of Department are encouraged to nominate R eferees with an appropriate profile which could include referees from outside the Department’s discipline. 8.3 Confidentiality Referees are advised that any reference provided i n connection with the Major Review and/or Promotion processes will be confidential to the Promotions Committee and will be used solely for the purposes of the School\\'s Review and Promotion processes. The references are not normally disclosed to Major Review and/or Promotion candidates or to Heads of Departments. However, in circumstances such as a Major Review appeal hearing, grievance or legal proceedings, references may have to be disclosed to a third party. 32 9 PROCEDURES OF THE REVIEW AND PROMOTION PROCESS 9.1 Procedure for Interim Review or Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor The c ore format of Interim Review and Major Review is that a recommendation from the Assistant Professor’s Head of Department on whether the Assistant Professor should pass the relevant Review is made to the Promotions Committee, which then makes the decis ion on the basis of all the evidence in front of it. The detai led procedure for Interim Review and/or Major Review comprises the following stages: 1. Notification from Human Resources Assistant Profess ors scheduled to undergo a Rev iew will receive notification from Human Resources prior to the academic session in which the Review is expected to take place informing them of the forthcoming procedure and enclosing a c opy of these Guidelines. Assis tant Professors will be informed where the relevant documentation can be loc ated on the Human Resources website. Please note that candidates for review and promotion will need to have their student surv ey results from up to the four preceding academic ses sions available. This teaching data can be helpful for candidates to comment on their scores on the relevant template form and Heads of Department to refer to candidates’ teaching performance in their recommendations. The questionnaire results can be made available to the Head of Department by the Teaching Quality and Assurance Office (TQARO). A reference guide to the deadlines and documentation required can be found at Annex D. 2. Consultation between Head of Department and staff member The Assistant Professor has the opportunity to s ubmit to their Head of Department any information that they consider relevant, or to as k for a deferral of the Review if they so desire. The procedure for submitting information varies between Departments: the Head of Department will offer the opportunity of a discussion meeting with the Assistant Professor and/or the Assistant Professor will be given the opportunity to submit a written statement about their work which the Head of Department will use in preparation of their st atement to the Promotions Committee. This discussion should inc lude any relevant candidate\\'s personal circumstances that either the Head of Department or the candidate feels the Promotions Committee should take into ac count (for example, any significant periods of absence or if the candidate has a disability or chronic condition which has had a significant impact on their work), and an agreement reached on what the candidate and, where the candidate so wishes, the Head of Department should declare on the Optional Dec laration of Individual Circumstances Form G/8. For further information about individual circumstances see Section 1.6. The Head of Department should give the Assistant Professor a reasonable period of notice in either case. 3. Documentation submission by Head of Department If, after appropriate cons ultations with colleagues and consideration of the information provided by the Assistant Professor subject to Review, the Head of Department is of the view that the required level of progress is being made towards Major Review (for Interim Review candidates) or that they should pass Major Rev iew with promotion to Associate Professor (for Major Review candidates), the Head of Department will submit a full statement to the Promotions Committee on the Head of Department Statement G/1 recommending that the individual should pass their Interim Review or Major Rev iew. For Interim Review candidates, if, after the consultations and consideration referred to above, the Head of Department is of the view that the Assistant Profes sor is not making the 33 required level of progress towards Major Review and there are either no reasons for deferral or the maximum time limit for Interim Review has been reached the Head of Depar tment will submit a full statement to the Promotions Committee setting out the reasons and reporting on the Assistant Professor’s progress and activities in research and publication, teaching, and service to the School. For those undergoing Interim Review, in addition to their statement, the Head of Department will be asked to suggest the names of external referees for the Promotions Committee’s consideration using the relevant template form. Where it considers it appropriate, the Promotions Committee may c anvass the views of one or more such outside referees. For Major Review candidates, if, after the consultations and consideration referred to above, the Head of Department cannot recommend that the Assistant Professor pass Major Review with promotion to Associate Professor and there are either no reasons for deferral or the maximum time limit for Major Review has been reached the Head of Department will submit a full statement to the Promotions Committee setting out the reasons and reporting on the Assistant Professor\\'s progress and activities as above. 4. Additional information: If, in the period between the Head of Department submitting their statement and the Promotions Committee considering the case, any new information arises which the candidate/Head of Department wishes to be taken into account by the Promotions Committee, the candidate/Head of Department should submit the information to Human Resour ces for onward transmission to the Committee. 5. Decision of the Promotions Committee: The Promotions Committee will consider each recommendation individually and then reach a decision whether the Assistant Professor should pass their Interim and/or Major Re view. Interim Review Heads of Department should note that the Promotions Committee is in no way bound to follow the recommendation of the Head of Department. It is a basic School principle that Review recommendations are subject to assessment and evaluation by Professors from other departments. It is open to the Promotions Committee either to endorse the recommendation, to reject it, or to defer the Assistant Professor’s Interim Review subject to the maximum time limits as set out in Section 2.1. This latter step will be taken only where the Promotions Committee considers that either the School or the Assistant Professor, or both, would benefit from the Promotions Committee having the possibility to consider the Assistant Professor’s position again after the deferral (and so offering scope, where relevant, for any material coming into being during the period of the deferral to be considered by the Promotions Committee). The Promotions Committee may ask the VCAC to maintain a watching brief on progress. In the case of Interim Rev iew, if a majority of the members of the Promotions Committee are doubtful about the Head of Department’s recommendation, the Committee may ask the Head of Department to suggest the names of external referees for the Promotions Committee’s consideration. Where it considers it appropriate, the Promotions Committee may canvass the views of one or more such outside referees. Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor At the Major Review stage, the progress of an Assistant Professor will be considered in terms of the elements outlined in Section 3.5. Major Review is not a competitive exercise but an assessment of whether an individual should be promoted to the role of Associate Professor. The Promotions Committee will consider the Assistant Professor’s contribution in its entirety, taking into account progress made since they passed Interim Review. If the Assistant Professor was appointed subject to Major Review only the Promotions Committee will consider the Assistant Professor’s progress since their appointment at the School.  34 9.2 Consideration of Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor and Promotion Cases Before reaching a decision in each case the Promotions Committee will take account of the external opinions as expressed by the Referees and of the internal opinions as expressed in the Head of Department’s Statement G/1 and the opinion of the Internal Reader assigned to assess the candidate’s publications as well as the Internal Monitor. The Promotions Committee is in no way bound to follow the recommendation of the Head of Department. It is a basic School principle that d epartmental recommendations are subject to assessment and evaluation by Professors from other departments. It is open to the Promotions Committee either to endorse the recommendation, to reject it, or (in the case of an Assistant Professor’s Major Review with Promotion to Associate Profess or case) to defer the decision subject to the maximum time limits as set out in Section 2.2. Role of Promotions Committee Readers All submitted writings will be read by a member of the Promotions Committee from a related department or discipline (or a member of the Appointments Committee). All readers are required to submit a short written review of the writings to the Promotions Com mittee. Their views serve as a basis for discussion by the Promotions Committee. The identity of the reviewer(s) and the contents of their written reports are not revealed to the candidates. The VCAC or the Promotions Committee may decide that member(s) of the Promotions Committee (or a member of the Appointments Committee) in addition to the nominated Committee member should read the writings. Grading Criteria Internal Readers read candidates’ submitted writings and apply the grading criteria agreed by the Promotions Committee as part of their summative evaluation of cases using the grading scale A -D where, A - Outstanding case B - I am confident in my judgement that this case clearly meets the criteria for review and/or promotion C - Merits full discussi on by Committee. D - Case looks inadequate – merits full discussion by Committee. Role of Promotions Committee Monitors All Major Review and/or promotion cases will have one principal Internal Reader with a second member of the Committee appointed to each case in the role of ‘Monitor’. The purpose of the monitoring role is to ensure equity of treatment in the consideration of cases. The Monitor is provided with a full copy of the candidate’s papers as listed in Sections 3.5 and 3.7. The M onitor does not read the candidate’s submitted pieces as a matter of routine, although copies of writings are provided on request. The Monitor will provide a brief comment on the case. The comments of the Monitor are in addition to close reading of the cases by the appointed Internal Reader. Should the Internal Reader award a grade of C or D to the candidate, then the Internal Monitor automatically becomes the Second Internal Reader, in which case they will also read the candidates’ submitted writings. Deferral of cases to a later meeting Where, in the view of the Internal Reader / Monitor / Committee, a case is deemed to be either category ‘C’ or ‘D’ under the Promotions Committee grading scale or there is insufficient evidence to make a decision, a decision on the case may be deferred to the next meeting of the Promotions Committee to allow for further opinion(s) to be sought / further information to be gathered. Where this occurs, the candidate and Head of Department will 35 be informed of the adjustment in the timescale. 9.3 Consideration of S elf-Sponsored Promotion Proposals Indi viduals wishing to propose themselves for promotion on a self-sponsored basis are free to submit the self-sponsored proposal through their Head of Department or directly to Human Resources. Tem plate forms, along with a full copy of this Guidance, can be found on the Human Resources website. P romotion proposals are considered solely on merit by the Promotions Committee according to the criteria for promotion to the level sought. In al l cases, Human Resources will write to the candidate\\'s Head of Department requesting a full written statement about the work of the self-sponsored candidate. The Head of Department will be asked to state their opinion of the quality of the research and published output and to set out clearly and unambiguously the full range of opinions amongst the departmental professoriate. If the self-sponsored promotion proposal is submitted through the Head of Department, the Head of Department is free to submit their statement on the work of the candidate with the promotion documentation. B efore reaching a decision in each case the Promotions Committee will take account of the external opinions as expressed by the Referees, of the internal opinions as expressed in the promotion proposal, and the opinions of the Internal Reader and Internal Monitor assigned to assess the candidate\\'s publications. 9.4 Procedure following Failure at Interim or Major Review In cases where candidates have been put forward before their scheduled Interim or Major Review date, and the Promotions Committee is not willing to pass the candidate, the procedure outlined under, respectively, Se ctions 3.3 or 3.6 will apply. In all other cases, should a member of staff fail to meet the requirements of Interim or Major Review, the candidate and their Head of Department will be advised of this decision in writing. In suc h circumstances the member of s taff will be invited in writing to attend a formal hear ing to discuss th e matter by thei r Head of Department. The hearing will be chaired by either the Vice Pres ident and Pro-V ice Chancellor (Fac ulty Development) or another Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor, with the VCAC, the Head of Department and HR Partner also present. This hearing will be to explain the circumstanc es and decision of the Promotions Committee. The staff member will be given the opportunity to res pond to the outcome of the Promotions Committee, before a final decision is made regarding termination of employment (as they have failed to pass the School’s ac ademic probationary process). Right to Be Accompanied The academic member of staff may be accompanied at the hearing by a companion employed by the School or a trade union representative. This companion may speak on the academic member of staff’s behalf but may not answer questions addressed directly to the academic member of staff. It is the academic member of staff’s responsibility to notify the chosen c ompanion of the details of the hearing inc luding the date, time and location of the hearings as well any relevant documentation relating to the case.  36 Academic members of staff are requested to give notice of the name and relevant details of any companion to the HR Partner at least 3 working days prior to a hearing under this procedure. If the companion is not available at the time proposed for the hearing, the academic member of staff may request that the hearing is postponed once to another reasonable time not being later than 5 working days after the date first proposed for the hearing. Procedure The Head of Department will write to the academic member of staff setting out the reasons for the proposed termination of the employee\\'s employment in line with the decision reached by the Promotions C ommittee and invite the employee to a hearing. The academic member of staff will have the opportunity to respond at the hearing before any decision is taken, and will be provided with copies of any relevant documentation to be considered at the hearing. The academic member of staff will be advised of the right to be accompanied by a companion employed by the School or a trade union representative. Following the hearing the Head of Department will confirm the outcome of the hearing normally within 5 workin g days of the hearing. Should it be confirmed that the academic member of staff’s employment will be terminated, the individual will receive notice of termination in line with their contract of employment. The School normally extends the staff member’s end date of their existing contract by one year in order to allow the staff member time to find alternative employment. The staff member will also be advised of the right of appeal. Right of Appeal The procedure to be used by the academic member of staff is the appeals procedure contained in the School’s Academic Annex. This would be the final internal stage in the process. 9.5 Emergency Procedures for Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor / Promotion to Professor The Promotions Committee has agreed the following criteri a for emergency procedures: \\uf0a7 Evidence, in the form of a written offer from a comparator peer academic institution is required. Offers from the commercial sector are not deemed relevant in this context. \\uf0a7 The Promotions Committee would, unless in exceptional circumstances, expect confirmation from the Head of Department that the candidate would in any event, be put forward in the forthcoming review and promotion round. The Appointments Committee has agreed the following two procedures to deal with emergency requests for Major Review and/or Promotion which arise out of phase. The emergency procedures cannot be used for late applications for Major Review or promotion. Procedure (1) [Emergency which arise in session] Procedure (1) is designed to deal with emergency requests for Major Review and/or Promotion which arise during the session outside the normal annual cycle (and including normally, the Winter and Spring vacations). Procedure (1) is identical (except in timing) to the procedures used for the main Review and Promotions exercise but the procedure is accelerated as far as possible so that a decision may be reached at an early opportunity – normally at the next scheduled meeting of the Promotions Committee. The Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) will determine on advice from the VCAC, whether the individual circumstances justify the use of Procedure (1). Heads  37 of Department are advised therefore, to contact the VCAC in the first instance. Procedure (2) [Emergency Proposals which arise out of session] Procedure (2) is designed to achieve as far as possible a procedure which remains comparable to the main Review and Promotions exercise. As with Procedure (1), the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) will determine on advice from the VCAC whether Procedure (2) should be triggered. Heads of Department should, therefore, contact the VCAC in the first instance. Having achieved consent for the case to proceed under Procedure 2, the Head of Department should submit the documentation for Major Review and/or Promotion to Human Resources. Heads of Department are advised that the emergency procedures cannot be initiated until complete documentation is received by Human Resources consisting of the following elements: \\uf0a7 A statement from the candidate’s Head of Department reporting on the candidate’s progress in research, teaching and contributions to the Department and the School \\uf0a7 A CV presented on the standard template including a statement from the candidate on their contributions to education, a research achievement record and a statement of planned research, and a contribution s to citizenship statement. The Promotions Committee will seek opinions from two external Referees, r nominated by the Department on the relevant template forms. Heads of Department should refer to the relevant sections of these Guidelines for further information on the headings to be addressed in the Head of Department’s Statement (Section 4.7), criteria for selection of Referees ( Section 8.2), and writings ( Secti on 7). A reference guide to the deadlines and documentation required can be found at Annex D, the Criteria for Interim and Major Review, and promotion to Professor, can be found at Section 3. Template forms, along with a full copy of this Guidance, can al so be found on the Human Resources website. A Panel comprising members of the Promotions Committee will have authority to consider emergency requests which arise out of session. The Panel’s membership will normally comprise the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development), the VCAC, and the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Education). Panel members will consider a full set of papers relating to the candidate, comprising: \\uf0a7 Head of Department\\'s Statement G/1 \\uf0a7 Candidate’s CV (including contributions to education statement, research trajectory & research achievement record, and contributions to citizenship statement) G/2 \\uf0a7 School student survey results \\uf0a7 Reports of two external Referees nominated by the Department \\uf0a7 Report of the Internal Reader and Monitor (normally Promotions Committee members) The Panel, having considered all the relevant information as described above, will reach an initial decision. The Panel will make a recommendation to the full Promotions Committee which will be asked, by circulation, to endorse it. In the event that any two members of the Promotions Committee raise an objection, the decision will be held over until the first schedul ed meeting of the Promotions Committee in the following academic year (for the dates of the upcoming session please contact Human Resources). For emergency proposals dealt with under Procedure (2), the aim will be to reach a decision within four weeks of the date the Department delivers the completed documentation to  38 Human Resources. Heads of Department should note that this timetable may be affected by factors outside the Promotions Committee’s control such as the availability and goodwill of external aca demic colleagues to act on short notice. In exceptional circumstances, the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development), on advice from the VCAC, may agree to amend Procedure (2) to facilitate a decision on a particular case sooner than the one-month period.  39 10 DECISIONS OF THE PROMOTIONS COMMITTEE 10.1 Notification of Decisions Decisions of the Promotions Committee remain confidential until candidates have been notified in writing of the outcome. Letters, copied to the Head of Department, will normally be issued within 10 working days following the conclusion of the meeting. Letters will normally be signed by the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) or, alternatively, by the VCAC. Successful Interim Review If a majority of the members of the Promotions Committee is of the view that an Assistant Professor fulfils the requirements for passing Interim Review, the Assistant Professor concerned will pass Interim Review. Unsuccessful Interim Review If the Promotions Committee’s decision is that the Assistant Professor has not passed Interim Review, the Assistant Professor will be informed of this view in writing with an outline summary of reasons by the Chair of the Promotions Committee as soon as possible after the meeting. For further information please see Section 9.4 – Procedure following Failure at Interim or Major Review. Successful Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor If a majority of the members of the Promotions Committee is of the view that an Assistant Professor fulfils the requirements for passing Major Review, the Assistant Professor concerned will pass Major Review and will be promoted to the career grade of Associate Professor, normally from the following 1 August. Staff will be issued with the role profile applicable for Associate Professors. Staff successful at Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor are free to seek promotion to Professor in the next round. Such candidates must keep in mind, however, that the Promotions Committee normally expects candidates to submit four publications and that, unles s in exceptional circumstances, none of these can be the ones that were submitted for the Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor application. Unsuccessful Major Review with Promotion to Associate Professor If the Promotions Committee’s decision is that the Assistant Professor has not passed Major Review, the Assistant Professor will be informed of this view in writing with an outline summary of reasons by the Chair of the Promotions Committee as soon as possible after the Promotions Committee meeting, but in good time before a meeting is convened by the Head of Department. For further information please see Section 9.4 – Procedure following Failure at Interim or Major Review. Successful Promotion If a majority of the members of the Promotions Committee is of the view that a post-Major Review Lecturer / Assistant Professor fulfils the requirements for promotion to Associate Professor, the staff member concerned will be promoted to the career grade of Associate Professor, normally from the following 1 August. Staff will be issued with the role profile applicable for Associate Professors. If a majority of the members of the Promotions Committee is of the view that an Associate Professor fulfils the requirements for promotion to Professor, the staff member concerned  40 will be promoted to the career grade of Professor, normally from the following 1 August. Staff will be issued with the role profile applicable for Professors. Unsuccessful Promotion Applications Unsuccessful candidates will be sent a personal letter setting out the reasons for the Promotions Committee’s decision. Unsuccessful candidates are encouraged to seek a meeting with the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) in their capacity as Chair of the Promotions Committee or with the VCAC, to discuss their case. There is no right of appeal against decisions reached by the Promotions Committee on promotion to Professor cases (the same applies for promotion to Associate Professor for post-Major Review Lecturers / Assistant Professors). The candidate’s Head of Department will also be informed of the reasons for the Committee’s decision. Waiting Period and Re-Applications The convention is that, normally, there should be a two-year gap between submissions of promotion proposals following an unsuccessful promotion attempt. In exceptional cases, the Promotions Committee may agree that a case may come before it again in the next promotion round without waiting for two years to elapse. There is no limit on the number of occasions on which a candidate may be put forward for promotion. The Promotions Committee will not have before it information about any previous unsuccessful promotion proposals for this candidate. Reporting to the Appointments Committee The names of all successful Review and Promotion candidates are reported to the Appointments Committee. 10.2 Salary Determination Interim Review Staff passing Interim Review will normally have their salaries increased to the minimum salary for post-Interim Review Assistant Professors on Step 41.5, or receive two additional increments, whichever increase is greater. The salary increase will normally take effect from the following 1 August.

Annex A PROMOTIONS COMMITTEE: Terms of Reference and Membership 1. Purpose of Committee The Promotions Committee is the formal School decision-making body which considers and reaches decisions on departmental recommendations for Interim Review and Major Review. The Committee is also the decision-making body for proposals to promote members of the academic staff to Associate Professor and Professor and, members of the research staff to Assistant Professorial Research Fellow, Associ ate Professorial Research Fellow and Professorial Research Fellow, and members of the Education Career Track staff to Associate Professor (Education) and Professor (Education). The Promotions Committee is a Sub-Committee of the Appointments Committee and is chaired by the Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development). 2. Membership The membership of the Promotions Committee is approved annually by the Appointments Committee and comprises ex officio: Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Faculty Development) (Chair) Vice-Chair of the Appointments Committee Vice President and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Education) And fifteen professorial members nominated from the fi ve Academic Board constituency Groups. There are three professorial representatives from each Academic Board Group. Professors currently serving as Heads of Department are ineligible to be considered for Committee membership until their term as Head of Department expires. From the 2016/17 academic session onwards, no less than one third of the fifteen professorial members nominated from the five Academic Board constituency Groups should be women and no less than one third should be men. The VCAC will be required to explain in the VCAC annual report to the Appointments Committee why this target could not be met if it was not met in a specific year. The Committee is supported by Human Resources. 3. Nomination Procedure Nominations to fill vacancies arising on the Promotions Committee will be sought from Heads of Department. It will normally be expected that nominations will carry the support of all Heads from within the Group(s) in which vacancies occur. The VCAC works together with Heads of Department to seek gender and disciplinary balance as well as representation of smaller Departments in their nomination of candidates. In the interests of ensuring that the Committee retains an appropriate balance in terms of gender, subject coverage across disciplines and representation of smaller departments, the VCAC has discretion to nominate up to five professorial representatives to serve on the Committee. The VCAC\\'s nominees may be drawn from any of the five Academic Board Groups. 4. Term of Office One half of the elected members of the Promotions Committee will normally retire from the Committee at the end of each academic session and no appointed member who has served a full term of office  Annex A (which is normally two years) will be re-eligible until thr ee further years have elapsed. Casual vacancies are filled by the appointment of a new member drawn from the Academic Board Group in which the vacancy occurs, who will serve for the unexpired period of the appointment. 5. Code of Conduct Committee members are expected to take a School -wide view of the issues before them and not to represent departmental views. Furthermore, Committee members from the same department as a candidate under consideration are not permitted to participate in discussion of the case, except to provide factual clarification if called upon by the Chair. In the case of a self-sponsored promotion proposal, Committee members from the same department as the candidate will be requested to leave the room while the case is considered. Commit tee members are expected to make themselves available to attend every meeting in view of the importance of maintaining continuity in the deliberations of the Committee. Committee members are expected to respect the importance of dealing with the work of the Committee in the strictest confidence at all times. Members should not reveal the Committee\\'s deliberations in any part outside of meetings. 6. Schedule of meetings The dates of the Committee\\'s annual schedule of meetings are published in the School Calendar.

       "  'text': \"1 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE aims to recruit, retain and motivate the best possible employees and, as part of this objective, wants to support employees to combine work with family commitments. As part of this commitment, parental leave is available to all eligible employees within the diverse School community, including LGBTQ+, same -sex families and those who have a surrogacy arrangement. 1.2. This policy uses the following key terms : • Birth parent / mother: the individual who gives birth to a child. They can be male, female or of a non- binary identity. • Partner: the child’s biological father or the partner of the birth parent / mother / adopter. This can be a spouse, civil partner, or a partner who is living in an enduring relationship with the birth parent / mother and the child. Partners may be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non- binary identity). • Adopter: the person who is eligible for adoption leave and/or pay. Adopters may be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non- binary identity) • Parent s: the child’s biological parents or individuals that, although not biological parents, have parental responsibility for the child (ie, named on the child’s birth certificate, on the adoption certificate, on the parental order, a legal guardianship). Parents may be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non -binary identity). 2. Policy aims 2.1. The aim of parental leave is to allow employees the opportunity to take time off to care for a child. Reasons why an employee may wish to take unpaid parental leave include wanting to: • spend more time with their children and achieve a better balance between their Parental Leave Policy Operational 2 work and family commitments • spend more time with the wider family, i.e. visiting grandparents • be with the child during the initial stages of new childcare arrangements • accompany a child during a planned hospital stay. 2.2. There are other policies in place for absences for reasons other than parental leave for example, compassionate, or ‘time off’ for family and dependents. 3. Policy principles 3.1. Parental leave differs from paternity /partner’s leave. Paternity /partner’s leave is paid leave (twenty working days, pro rata for less than full -time employment) to be taken before and around the time of childbirth or adoption, or within a reasonable time period afterwards. It also differs from ‘shared parental’, maternity or adoption leave. 4. Eligibility requirements 4.1. Parental leave, which is unpaid, is a legal entitlement for employees who are the parents of children aged up to 18. 4.2. Parental leave can be applied for by an employee who, by the time of the proposed start of the parental leave, has completed a year ’s continuous service and: • is a named parent on the birth or adoption certificate ; or • has or expects to have formal parental responsibility; or • is a step-parent (where parental responsibility has been agreed between all parents) 4.3. In the case of multiple births or the adoption of more than one child as part of the same placement, the employee has a statutory right to take unpaid parental leave in respect of each child. 4.4. Foster parents are not eligible for parental leave1. 5. Amount of parental leave 5.1. Employees are entitled to up to a maximum of 18 weeks’ unpaid leave for each child, up to their 18th birthday. 1 A fost er parent is the person who cares for a child as part of their family. 3 5.2. The maximum amount of parental leave that may be taken in any one year 2 in respect of a child is four weeks. According to statutory provisions, t his is to be taken in blocks of not less than one week, except where the child is disabled, in which case it may be taken one day at a time 3. 5.3. As part of LSE’s positive support of employees who are working parents, employees who are eligible for parental leave can request the following: • one complete block of four weeks • several one- week periods • shorter working weeks. 5.4. If the dates requested for taking a block of leave would substantially prejudice the School's work, then the employee may be required to postpone the leave but not indefinitely and not usually for more than six months. Managers cannot postpone parental leave requested to immediately follow childbirth or adoption. 6. Change of employer 6.1. An employee's total entitlement to parental leave is limited to 18 weeks per child, irrespective of whether they change employer. If, for example, an employee has taken four weeks' parental leave (out of a total entitlement of 18 weeks) during their current employment, the employee will have 14 weeks' parental leave outstanding on moving to new employment. According to the statutory provisions, t he employee will, however, have to work for a full year with the new employer before becoming eligible to take any of their entitlement. 2 For the purpose of this policy, a year is the period of 12 months beginning when the employee first becomes entitled to parental leave in respect of the child in question, and each successive period of 12 months beginning on the anniversary of that date. 3 A ‘week’ equals the length of time an employee normally works over seven days. 4 Parental Leave Procedure 1. Introduction 1.1. The procedure provides information on the steps that qualifying employees are required to follow to be eligible for parental leave. 2. Notification requirements 2.1. The statutory requirements are that employees must give at least 21 days' notice before their intended start date. T he notice must be given in writing and confirm the dates on which the period of parental leave is to begin and end. 2.2. An employee who wishes to take a period of parental leave beginning when their child is born, must give at least 21 days ’ notice before the expected week of childbirth, and must specify the expected week of childbirth and the duration of the period of parental leave requested. It is requested that such notice is given together with notice of the intention to take paid Paternity /Partner’s leave. 2.3. Similarly, whe n parental leave is requested to begin on an adopted child's placement, the employee's notice must be given at least 21 days before the beginning of the week in which the child is to be placed for adoption, or as soon as is reasonably practicable thereafter. The not ice must specify the week in which the adoption placement is expected to occur and the duration of the period of parental leave requested. 2.4. In case s where it is not possible to give notice of 21 days, e.g. if the child is born prematurely or where less than 21 days' notice is given that a child is to be placed with the employee for adoption, then the employee should give notice as soon as practicable. 2.5. It is the responsibility of the employee and the manager to keep a record of any leave requested, agreed and taken. A copy of the record should be sent to the relevant HR Adviser so that employees receive the correct salary payments and future requests for parental leave are properly managed. These records will also be use d to respond to requests by other employers about how much parental leave an employee/ ex-employee has already taken, although there is no legal duty to provide such information. 3. Postponing parental leave 3.1. If the dates requested for taking a block of leave would substantially prejudice LSE's work, the leave may be postponed but not indefinitely and not usually for more than six months. Employees and manager s are encouraged to discuss the request in an attempt to reach an agreement on alternative time or times when the leave could be taken. Where they are unable to agree, and the employee is an academic member of staff, the matter shall be referred to the Vice- Chair of the Academic Board for a decision within ten working days. 5 3.2. Parental leave cannot be postponed if: • There is no significant reason to delay this • It is requested to be taken immediately follow the birth or adoption of a child • It means an employee would no longer qualify for parental leave (i.e. postponing it until after the child’s 18th birthday) 3.3. If parental leave is postponed, managers must write to the employee within seven days of the original request explaining the reason( s) and propos ing a new start date. The new start date must be within six months of the requested start date. Managers cannot change the amount of leave being requested. 4. Documentary evidence of eligibility 4.1. A line manager may, at their discretion, request documentary evidence from an employee to support a request for parental leave. This might be: - the child's birth certificate, in order to ascertain that the child is under 18 years old - the adoption certificate; - evidence of the child's entitlement to Disability Living Allowance, where the employee is exercising a right in relation to a disabled child 4.2. A line manager may also wish to check whether an employee requesting parental leave has previously taken any periods of parental leave while working for a previous employer and, if so, how many weeks' leave were taken. Line managers should note, however, that there is no legal duty on employers to provide this information. 5. Return to work 5.1. The notice of the intention to take parental leave must confirm the dates on which the period is to begin and end. Following the end of parental leave, the employee is expected to return on the next working day. ; there is no requirement for additional notice of return. 5.2. Return to work to the same job is guaranteed following a standalone period of parental leave. If parental leave of any length is taken immediately after additional maternity leave, additional adoption leave or additional paternity leave, and it is not reasonably practicable for a return to the same job, then suitable alternative work with the same status and on terms and conditions which are no less favourable than the original job may be offered 6 6. Contract of employment 6.1. During parental leave, the employee's contract of employment continues in force and the same terms and conditions apply. Employees are entitled to receive all their contractual benefits, except for salary, contractual holiday entitlement and pension contributions. 7. Annual leave 7.1. During parental leave, an employee continues to accrue their statutory paid holiday entitlement during parental leave, but not their contractual paid holiday entitlement. Employees and managers should seek advice from their HR Adviser concerning any related queries. 8. Pension contributions 8.1. Pension contributions will not be made during periods of unpaid parental leave. Should the employee wish, they can continue to make pension contributions during their period of unpaid leave in line with the pension scheme rules. 9. Advice 9.1. An employee considering/taking parental leave is encouraged to contact their manager to discuss their request. Employees and managers may wish to contact their HR Adviser, HR Partner or trade union representative for further advice. 7 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 September 2026 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 November 2017 JNICC 2 January 2023 JNICC Links Reference Link Contacts Position Name Email Notes HR Policy Adviser Elisabetta Viotto e.viotto@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': '1 Introduction 1.1 It is sometimes necessary for the School to make changes to the way work, job roles or the School is structured. This need can arise from changes in work priorities, planned or unplanned changes to funding and/or the need to ensure that work is organised in the most effective way possible to meet the strategic and operational needs of the organisation. There will also be other legitimate circumstances that lead to organisational changes being considered. 1.2 In some cases change will be minimal and/or may be wholly welcomed by those whom it affects. In others, the changes may be more substantial and/or have a potentially negative impact on job roles that needs to be managed carefully and sensitively. This policy sets out the principles of managing change fairly and transparently, to ensure that all organisational changes are handled appropriately and proportionately to the ir scale and impact. Scope of Policy 2.1 This policy applies to organisational change affecting any groups or individual members of staff. Organisational change is defined as planned structural changes that may lead to any significant change in job content, work location, team structures and/or number and grade of posts. Any scenario in which redundancies and/or the down -grade of posts are a possibility should be managed in accordance with this policy. 2.2 Minor changes, e.g. the move of a role from one unit within a larger Division to another entailing a change in line management only, but where the role remains the same, formally fall outside the scope of this policy, though managers may wish to refer to the policy principles nonetheless to ensure s taff feel such changes have been handled positively. Such changes may, however, be dealt with on a much more informal basis and typically within shorter time -frames. 2.3 Professional service re -grades that occur on an individual basis do not fall under th e scope of this policy and instead the Professional Services Re -grade Policy and Procedure should be followed. Organisation al Change Policy Operational 2 2.4 Whilst this policy may include all staff in its scope, the procedures that are followed in relation to redundancy and/or redeployment will vary according to staff grouping and individual circumstances, where relevant. Policy Aims This policy aims to en sure that the School meets its statutory responsibilities with respect to consultation and to encourage a culture where staff feel that changes are normally made after they have had an opportunity to comment upon matters that may significantly affect their working arrangements at LSE. 3.2 This policy aims to set a framework for the way in which change is managed, whilst acknowledging that each restructuring case will be different and a flexible approach that can be tailored to the circumstances is more bene ficial for both staff and the organisation. Policy Principles Collective communication The School will undertake collective communication with relevant recognised trade union(s) and their elected representatives where a restructuring exercise or significant change in service provision is proposed that has substantial employee implications (as defined in Paragraph 2.1). Where the proposed changes are likely to lead to redundancies, communication will be undertaken in accordance with the School’s re dundancy policy and procedures. Such proposals will always require the authorisation to proceed to consultation stage by the Director of HR following the submission of an appropriate business case outlining the restructuring need and potential risk of redu ndancies. Written communication that can be shared with both trade unions and members of staff will usually be expected to ensure that there is a common understanding of the driver for change and the proposal that is being made. This will normally take the form of a formal paper; email communication outlining the proposed change(s) may be sufficient in the case of more minor changes. 4.2 Effective communication Communication is essential at all stages of the change management process. A communication strategy, which details the process to be followed will normally be expected as part of any written proposals and should be standard practice in the case of major and complex change. It may also include the names of individuals who can provide further advice a nd information, details of how both formal and informal updates on progress will be communicated and time scales as appropriate. 4.3 Individual consultation Employees will be consulted regarding the purpose and detail of the change proposal and the steps to be followed in achieving the change. Individual consultation meetings will be undertaken with those directly affected by the proposals (i.e. those whose roles will change, or be at risk, if the proposals go ahead), to listen to any concerns from employe es and to give them an opportunity to 3 discuss the options available to them and for them to express their preferences in light of the proposals. Employee should be invited to bring, if they so wish, a trade union representative or a colleague or friend who is employed by the School to formal individual consultation meetings. 4.4 Equity and diversity To ensure fair treatment and provision of support by the School, managers should consider any equity and diversity implications of the proposals before launch ing the change process. This will normally involve conducting an Equality Impact Assessment, which should be standard practice in cases of major organisational review, to ensure that proposed changes do not discriminate against any protected group. This i ncludes equity, diversity and inclusion considerations in relation to students or customers (where this is applicable) as well as the staff potentially affected by the proposal. Members of staff affected by change processes are also encouraged to raise any equity and diversity concerns that they may have during the consultation process. 4.5 Measures to avoid or minimise redundancy The School is committed to exploring measures to avoid or minimise potential redundancies and to forward planning with respec t to resources within the relevant area wherever this is possible. Where redundancies are proposed, due consideration will be given to ways of avoiding redundancy or reducing the numbers involved. The School’s Redundancy Policies and Procedures should be consulted for further guidance and information in relation to this. 4.6 Commitment to Redeployment In accordance with the School’s Redeployment Policy and Procedure, support will be provided for employees who fail to secure a job as a result of a structu ral change or reorganisation. 4.7 Training and development Employees whose roles have changed significantly as a result of organisational change should be offered the opportunity to refresh their CDR within a reasonable time frame (including if out of cycle) and to discuss any new learning and development needs that arise as a result of the changes to their job role. 4.8 Clear outcomes and conclusions Following the end of any consultation period, managers should ensure that staff are clear on the final de cisions taken and what will be happening next, and when. Some communication may be to groups, others may be to individuals personally affected. It will normally be expected that such decisions will be confirmed in writing and that collective and/or individ ual meetings will be held as appropriate. 4.9 Support from HR Partners In planning for organisational change, managers should seek advice from their HR Partner when developing their proposals, but particularly in developing an appropriate consultation a nd communication process and considering any equity and diversity implications. HR Partners will also provide the initial point of contact for trade union communications and provide points of contact and information for staff. An HR Partner will support th e manager throughout the change process and provide advice and guidance on the usage of this, and other associated, policies. 4 Legislation • Employment Rights Act 1996 • Equality Act 2010 Related policies, procedures and guidance • Academic Annex • Redundancy policy and procedure – PSS • Redeployment policy and procedure – PSS • Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Policy Statement 5 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start Version history Version Date Approved by Notes Links Reference Link 123 abc 123 abc Contacts Position Name Email Notes HR Policy Manager Lisa Morrow l.morrow@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

The relevant Head of Department or Service Leader or Research Centre Director will also need to give approval for the re -grade request. 1.4. Line managers are advised to seek advice and support from their HR Partner (see Who’s Who [link]) when completing the paperwork. 2. Submitting the request 2.1. The line manager should submit the paperwork outlined in 1.1. to the Hr.Hera inbox. All documents should be se nt electronically. 2.2. HR will confirm receipt of the paperwork and check that it has been fully comp leted. Managers will be advised if any core information is missing that may delay the evaluation of the role if not provided. HR will anonymise the p aperwork before submitting to the re-grade panel by remo ving the individual’s name. 2.3. Re-grade pa nels meet on a bi-monthly schedule. Managers should check the sch edule here [link] when prepar ing paperwork if they wish to aim for a particular sess ion. Completed paperwork must be received by the sub mission d eadline in order to be considered at the n ext panel meeting. 3. The panel process Professional Services Grading Procedure Operational 2 3.1. A re-grade panel will be chaired by an HR Partner, a School representative and another memb er of HR - forming a pan el of three. All panel memb ers will be externa lly trained in the use of HERA. Re-grade panels will not consist of memb ers of HR or managers who are linked to the role be ing evaluated. 3.2. All panel members should declare any perceived conflict of interest when the list of roles to review is received, in order for a substitu te panel memb er to be found, where this is appropri ate. The Chair will determine whether a conflict of interest requires substitution or can simply be noted and, where the Chair has the potential co nflict, the Senior HR Partner, or nominee, will determine whether the Chair should be replaced. 3.3. The submission deadline will be three weeks before the panel are scheduled to meet, to allow each panel member time to independently evaluate the role(s) sch eduled for the next sessi on. 3.4. At the panel meeting, the panel members will discuss any differenc es in their evaluations, with a view to reaching agreeme nt on a final HER A ass essment. The Chair will make the final decision, based on the majority view. 3.5. The decision of the panel will be com municated in writing normally within five working days of the panel meeting to the line manager. Where the panel evaluation does not result in a re-grade, constructive feedback will be given to the line manager in writing to the line manager, to share with the emp loyee. 3.6. In the event that the panel feel unable to make a decision due to a lack of information or a major point of difference in interpretation, the line manager and the emp loyee will be contacted for further information or clarification. 3.7. The panel will consider the new information either virtually or in a meeting – whichever is reasonably prac ticable – and will endeavour to give a final response within five days of further information being received, subject to the co ntinued a vailability of panel members. 3.8. Where a re-grade request is succ essful, the effective date of the new grade for the role will be the d ate of the HER A panel meeting. 3.9. Where further information has been requested, as detailed in 3.6, should this lead to a succes sful re-grade then the effecti ve date of the n ew grading will a lso be that of the original HER A panel meeting. 4. The ‘revise and resubmit’ procedure 4.1. As detailed in 3.5, where a role has been assessed by the HER A panel but has not subsequently been re-grade d, written feedback will be given to the line manager, to sh are with the emp loyee. 4.2. Written feedback will not cover all 14 HER A compe tencies. The Chair of the p anel will formulate an appropri ate summary based on the most relevant compe tencies to the role. The Chair will draw attention to any areas where e vidence may have been weaker. 4.3. Should the manager and emp loyee believe that there is further information that can be provided, or that the Chair’s feedback indicates that there has been a fundamental misunderstanding of the role, the Job Descri ption and Role Review Form can be updated and resubmitted for a sec ond review by a differe nt panel. 4.4. The original Job Description and Role Profile should be updated using “track changes”, or anoth er editing method to ensure that the second panel can s ee bo th the information originally submitted, and the new information or e xplanatio n that is being provided. 4.5. Line managers a nd employees have a maximum of two weeks, i.e. 10 working days, from receiving the decision of the HER A panel to submitting revised documen ts. As with the original submission, the documents should be signed off by both the line manager and the relevant Head of Department or Service Leader.

       "  'text': ' December 2018 Approach to Staff Mental Health and Wellbeing Vision The School will provide an inclusive workplace where the physical, social, emotional and mental wellbeing of staff enables them to achieve their full potential and thrive at work. By fostering a working environment that supports employees’ wellbeing at work, the School aims to deliver an employee experience that engenders commitment and loyalty as well as enabling personal and collective success. The School seeks to support all strands of wellbeing in the workplace, whilst recognising that mental and emotional wellbeing can underpin much of a person’s sense of wellness. As such, developing a School environment that understands we all have mental h ealth that will fluctuate over time, just as we all have physical health that will change, is at the heart of our approach policy. Background and context In October 2017 the Government published “Thriving at work” an independent review of mental health and employers that sets o ut what employers can do to better support all employees, including those with mental health problems to remain in and thrive through work. It includes a detailed analysis that explores the significant cost of poor mental health to UK businesses and the economy as a whole. Poor mental health costs employers between £33 billion and £42 billion a year, with an annual cost to the UK economy of between £74 billion and £99 billion. The review quantifies how investing in supporting mental health at work is good for business and productivity. The most important recommendation is that all employers, regardless of size or industry, should adopt 6 ‘mental health core standards’ that lay basic foundations for an approach to workplace mental hea lth. It also details how large employers and the public sector can develop these standards further through a set of ‘mental health enhanced standards’. The review also makes a series of recommendations to government and other bodies. The Government ha s also drawn attention to the recent Universities UK ‘ Stepchange framework for Mental Health in HE ’1, as well as specific guidance relating to creating Suicide Safer Universities2 and Transitions guidance3 for students in their early terms at university. The School has now initiated a major review of its approach to MHW, drawing upon the Stepchange framework, which recommends a whole university approach to cover all areas of community, learning, living and support services4. The Government is planning to draw on 1 https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy -and-analysis/stepchange 2 https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy -and-analysis/reports/Documents/2018/guidance -for-sector -practitioners -on- preventing -student -suicides.PDF 3 http://www.studentminds.org.uk/transitionintouniversity.html 4 These elements comprise: COMMUNITY - promoting community awaren ess and cohesion LEARNING - fostering connectedness and motivation through learning communities, tutors, flexibility in course design/ assessment and regular feedback to reinforce the student -staff connection LIVING – enhancing social, physical and digital environments to support healthy cultures SUPPORT – good quality specialist services, effective signposting and linked academic policies  December 2018 the framework in creating a University Mental Health Charter, which will specify new MHW standards for universities5. Underpinning all of this is the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Management Standards which cover six key areas of work design that, if not properly managed, are associated with poor health, lower productivity and increased accident and sickness absence rates. Whilst taking a whole University approach to the wellbeing of both staff and students it is recognised that there are differing needs across the whole School community. This work will be effectively co -ordinated to ensure a collective approach is undertaken. Strategic Aims The working environment at LSE will be one where staff: a) Can work s afely, comfortably and with minimal risk to their health b) Feel valued and supported c) Have an appropriate work -life balance d) Are confident that their health and wellbeing matter to the LSE e) Feel confident, equipped and supported to demonstrate resilience and respond flexibly and positively to both temporary increases in demand and an evolving work environment f) Are provided with advice, support and a working environment that encourages healthy lifestyle choices g) Feel able to seek support from their line manager, work colleagues or other sources of assistance in relation to stress and other mental health issues. This will progressed through a Mental Health and Wellbeing Policy and a detailed action plan [link] which is underpinned by the following key themes: 1. Collaborating with key internal and external partners to create a shared understanding of wellbeing in the workplace and to develop appropriate wellbeing interventions. 2. Promoting better social, physical and mental wellbeing through an improved bank of informa tion resources and encouraging participation in healthy initiatives at individual, team and School levels. 3. Training and supporting our leaders and managers to manage staff effectively and create a healthy working environment. 4. Creating a community of wellbeing volunteers to develop and co -ordinate a range of ‘grassroots’ wellbeing initiatives, whilst providing opportunities for the wider School community to contribute ideas and to engage and connect with other members of staff. Governance The Human Re sources Committee will have a key role in overseeing the Mental Health and Wellbeing strategy and policy. Progress on the action plan will be taken to HRC with regular updates when relevant also being provided to Health and Safety Committee. The work will be championed at SMC by the Chief Operating Officer 5 The Government have invited Student Minds to engage in widescale collaboration with sector partners to develop the new University MH Charter over the course of 2018 -19, with an expected launch later in 2019 '},\n",

       "  'text': ' 1. Introduction LSE aims to ensure that there are appropriate resource s in place to fulfil required operations and sustain service level expectations. These aims are met through a combination of contractual arrangements, and, in some cases, staff may be required and /or requested to work additional hours to meet a particular demand. While t he School acknowledges the commitment of all staff, this policy sets out how staff at salary b ands 1 -5 who work additional hours may be appropriately and fairl y reward ed using overtime and time off in lieu ( TOIL) arrangements. In certain roles, there is an obligation that the postholder is required to work additional hours in line with operational requirements. In these cases, the terms are set out in the contractual appointment letter. For all staff employed on p rofessional services staff terms and conditions, pay is calculated based on a full -time member of staff working 35 hours per week (excluding lunch breaks), or a shift or other agreed working pattern which averages 35 hours per week over a year. Salaries are pro-rated for part -time staff. 2. Aims This policy sets out the fair and transparent principles to be followed by employees and managers in regard to how additional hours, TOIL and overtime are agreed and classified, with any appropriate payment rates clearly detailed. In addition, the policy details overtime arrangements for staff in respect of taking their statutory holiday leave allowance and the procedure which is used to compensate staff who regularly undertake overtime. 3. Scope The policy principles set out below cover all professional services staff on salary bands 1 -5. However, c ertain areas of LSE may require specifically agreed models on allocating overtime due to the operational requirements within those areas. For those areas, local principles on how overtime and TOIL are allocated may be developed in consultation with appropriate trade union representatives. Operational Professional Services Staff Overtime, Additional Hours and TOIL Policy  2 For professional services staff on salary bands 6 -10, TOIL and overtime payments do not apply. These staff will be expected to work in accordance with their terms and conditions and, therefore, may be required to work from time -to-time above their paid weekly hours to fulfil their duties. They will not normally be expected to work continuous or hea vy additional hours. 4. Restrictions All members of staff who work on a restricted visa which limits the total weekly hours worked must ensure that they follow the rules and limits within their visa prior to working any additional hours, regardless of how hours are classified. Under the Working Time Regulations, no individual working pattern should exceed working on average, 48 hours per week over a 17-week period. If both the member of staff and the line manager w ish to agree an opt -out from this restriction, they should contact their HR Partner for further advice. 5. Definitions of working hours terms The policy details a number of terms which refer to hours of work. Th ese include contractual hours of work, time off in lieu (TOIL), voluntary paid overtime, contract ual paid overtime and annua lised hours. The definitions of these terms are detailed in Appendix C. 6. Policy responsibilities for line manager s allocating additional hours worked, TOIL and overtime The responsibilities below detail how managers should manage all additional hours for all professional services staff at salary bands 1 -5 who work over and above their contracted hours of employment: 6.1. Before any additional hours are worked, the manager should confirm to the employee(s) how they will be classified : whether as TOIL or voluntary paid overtime. 6.2. Where overtime does not form part of the core resourcing model for an area, managers are expected to consider whether TOIL/overtime arrangements in their local area support their operational needs and are cost effective, as well as any potential detrimental impact on staff motivation and performance. This includes managers regularly reviewing and monitoring the use of TOIL/overtime and considering whether alternative staff resourcing models may offer a more effective way to manage operational needs. 6.3. Where there is a need for managers to request that staff work additional hours and overtime does not form part of the core resourcing model for an area, i t is expected that managers will consider TOIL as a first option. 6.4. Whether offering T OIL or overtime, managers should ensure that they offer this to all appropriate groups of staff in a fair, transparent and equitable way. 6.5. In areas where TOIL and /or overtime is offered on a regular basis, managers should, where reasonably possible, offer TOIL or overtime on a rotational basis in a fair and transparent way whilst balancing operational needs. 6.6. Managers shoul d agree TOIL and overtime hours in minimum blocks of 30 min/0.5 hour s. 6.7. Managers can provide TOIL and overtime to professional services staff in salary bands 1 -5 for agreed additional hours of work. For staff who work above and beyond their contract and duties, managers can additionally reward all professional services staff though the contribution pay process. Please see the Professional Services Staff Contribution Pay Guidance for further information.  3 6.8. Managers must process, record and pay overtime using the overtime claim form or bulk upload files and submit to fin.div.payroll@lse.ac.uk once overtime hours have been worked in line with monthly payroll deadlines. 7. Polic y responsibilities for members of staff working additional hours, TOIL and overtime The principles below detail how members of staff should agree additional hours work ed over and above their contracted hours of employment: 7.1. It is the responsibility of a member of staff to ensure that, when working additional hours, this has been agreed in advance with their line manager and that they understand whether the additional hours above their contract of employment are to be classified as TOIL or paid as overtime. 7.2. Members of staff who work additional hours without prior agreement should not normally expect to receive overtime payments or TOIL. 7.3. Members of staff are strongly encouraged to speak with their line manager if they feel that taking on additional work as TOIL or overtime could detriment their personal wellbeing and work life balance and/or whether they feel it may impede their ability to perform the duties of their role. 8. General principles around managing levels of additional hours worked, overtime and TOIL and payment rates 8.1. Accrued TOIL must not exceed a maximum balance of 35 hours at any point. Both managers and members of staff should regularly monitor and discuss how accrued TOIL should be managed to avoid exceeding the maximum balance of 35 hours. Only under exceptional operational requirements can th e 35 hours maximum balance be exceeded. This must be agreed to by the line manager in all circumstances. 8.2. Accrued TOIL should be taken at regular intervals to ensu re that staff are taking appropriate breaks when working additional hours. 8.3. Where areas of LSE operate a local flexible working practice which includ es TOIL, it should follow the principles set out in this policy, specifically around fairness and transparency. 8.4. TOIL should be recorded in writing and monitored at a local level between members of staff and their line manager. 8.5. Where voluntary overtime for full -time staff is required on a regular and ongoing basis, managers should consider whether this should be treated as a contractual overtime arrangement. It is recommended that managers review overtime resources/metrics on an annual basis to monitor this and a ny changes to contractual arrangements must be carried out in consultation with staff. Members of staff may also raise with their line manager if they consider a voluntary arrangement to have become a more permanent requi rement so that this may be considered. Managers should seek advice from their HR Partner in this situation. 8.6. Where additional hours are worked by part -time staff (including s alary band 6 and above), staff can submit a claim for these hours to be paid at their usual standard hourly pay rate up to a maximum of 35 hours per week in total. 8.7. Where additional hours are worked by part-time staff on a regular basis, this should be monitored and, where appropriate, consideration given to whether an adjustment to contracted hours of employment may be appropriate. Any changes to contractual working hours are subject to consultation with the member of staff. 8.8. If additional hours worked are agreed to be paid as overtime, the payment rates for working overtime (as set out in Appendix A) will apply.  4 9. Overtime and calculating pay during annual leave The first 20 days of annual leave in the calendar year (pro -rated for part time employees) will be leave under Regulation 13 of the Working Time Regulations 1998 (the “ Regulation 13 Days ”). In respect of the Regulation 13 Days, LSE will ensure that staff receive their normal pay in respect of regular voluntary paid overtime for staff. The principles of how these payments are calculated and processed are detailed in Appendix B.  5 Appendix A – Overtime Rates Where additional payment is authorised to be made as overtime payments, it shall be made in accordance with the below rates. The following rates apply to professional services staff on salary bands 1 -5. Extra hours worked: Salary Bands 1 -5 by part-time and hourly -paid staff (up to an average of 35 hours a week on an annual hours basis1) by catering services and cleaning services staff 1.0 time before/after normal working day (in excess of 35 hours a week) 1.5 time on rest days (e.g. Saturday and Sunday if normal working week is Monday to Friday and over 35 hours per week) 1.5 time on a second consecutive rest day worked 2.0 time on c losure days 1.5 time on b ank holidays 2.0 time Members of staff can check overtime payments in their monthly timesheets. For member s of staff who receive overtime payments and are member s of the SAUL pension scheme, overtime payments are superannuable. Overtime Protection Arrangements Some staff previously covered by the 1995 Portering Agreement and the 1997 Maintenance Technicians Agreement may receive lower overtime earnings under this policy because they were previously paid at higher premia for working Sundays, closure days or bank h olidays than are proposed under the new arrangements. For staff covered under this agreement, detailed information on the pay protection arrangements and rates are available in the areas affected by the 1995 Portering Agreement and the 1997 Maintenance Tec hnicians Agreement. Appendix B – Overtime payments whilst on annual leave All staff who are paid for working non -contractual overtime will receive ‘overtime related holiday pay’. The payment will be made at the same time as overtime is paid. This will be automatically applied as part of any submission of overtime hours to the Finance Division Payroll team. The payment will be based on the Regulation 13 Days. The payment rate for the Regulation 13 Days is calculated as an additional 8.3 percent on all overtime payments. This will be shown as a specific payment on pay slip s next to any overtime payment s. For staff who receive fixed contractual overtime payments, no additional ‘overtime related holiday pay’ will be made as this group of staff will continue to receive their fixed contractual overtime whilst on annual leave. 1 If staff in this category work on average, above 35 hours per week on an annual basis, the School will work to offer a change in contract to include an agreed level of contracted overtime into the contract.  6 Appendix C – Definitions of working hours terms Contractual Hours of Work • An employee’s contractual hours of work are set out in the appointment letter and accompanying terms and conditions of employment. Time off in lieu (TOIL) • TOIL is a period of time agreed between an employee and employer, to compensate an employee for working additional hours above and beyond their contracted hours of employment. This must be pre -approved and is in addition to annual leave. Voluntary Paid Overtime • Voluntary paid overtime refers to additional hours of work over and above an employee ’s contract ual hours of work which are carried out on an agreed or voluntary basis. The hours and the rates of payment are agreed prior to work being completed. • Voluntary paid overtime is offered on a discretionary basis and can be accepted or rejected by an employee. Contractual Paid Overtime • A small number of LSE staff are contracted to work in excess of a full -time working week. These staff receive contractual overtime pay which is guaranteed and superannuable. As it forms part of an employee’s contract of employment, it is payable when an employee is on holiday (including annual leave, School closure periods and bank holidays) or on sickness absence. Annualised Hours Contracts • Some groups of staff are contracted to work a set number of hours on an annual basis. These hours and work patterns can vary over the course of the year.  7 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 5 year August 2028 January 202 8 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 April 2023 JNICC Pending Approval 2 June 2023 JNICC Pending Approval Links Reference Link Contacts Position Name Email Notes Senior HR Policy Adviser Raj Lakhani r.lakhani@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 1. Introduction 1.1 Universities have wide -ranging responsibilities. Among the most fundamental of these is the responsibility to protect and promote freedom of speech and academic freedom, and to take the steps which are reasonably practicable to secure freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law1 (see Section 4 below). This includes enabling the questioning and debating of the laws that constrain free speech. Such activity is protected by freedom of speech within the law provided this is done in a way compliant with the legal framework. 1.2 Other legal obligations also exist which may set limits on certain freedoms, in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others, but the governing bodies of higher education providers must have particular regard to the importance of securing free speech and academic freedoms. 1.3 The School has adopted this Code of Practice (‘the Code’) to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is promoted and secured for students, employees and other members of the School (including honorary and visiting staff) and for all persons a uthorised to be on School premises, including visiting speakers. It also supports the School’s duty to promote and secure academic freedom for academic staff. 1.4 This Code supports the LSE Ethics Code principle of intellectual freedom. The Ethics Code supports the School’s commitment to intellectual freedom through the protection of individuals’ freedom of expression and by upholding the freedom to research and to convey the findings of research. 1.5 The School supports the Russell Group statement of Principles on Freedom of Speech. 1.6 The School Management Committee (SMC) will be responsible for policy issues connected with the interpretation of this Code, and will consider matters relevant to this Code as circumstances require. SMC will review the Code and consult with Academic Boa rd on significant changes to it. Council will approve the Code and also ensure that it brings both its duties and the Code to the attention of the School’s students annually. 1.7 ln accordance with the duties imposed upon it by Section 43 of the Education (No 2) Act 1986, as updated by the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 and the Higher Education 1 Where references are made to the law, this will refer to the laws of England and Wales, unless otherwise specified. Code of Practice on Free Speech Governance 2 (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, the Council of the School has approved the following Code of Practice to help ensure as far as reasonably practicable that freedom of speech within the law is secured for students and staff of the School and for visiting speakers and academic freedom is secured for academic staff. 2. Scope 2.1 This Code applies to all activities on any premises wherever situated, of which the School has title or possession, by freehold, leasehold, licence or otherwise, including its halls of residence, students' union premises and the Faith Centre ( ‘the Premises ’). It also applies as appropriate to all activities of staff or current students in any other location when carried out in the name of the School or of the LSESU or its members are using the School’s premises or engaged in events organised or sanctioned b y the School. 2.2 This Code makes particular provision in respect of activities such as meetings and events, including public lectures, conferences, lectures, seminars, committee meetings and musical and theatrical performanc es (‘Events ’). These are provided in Section 6 of the Code. The principles of this Code also apply to online events held by the School. 2.3 The School’s Memorandum of Understanding with the LSESU commits the Union to adhering to the provisions of this Code, in respect of events organised by its members which are held using the School’s premises or sanctioned by the School or LSESU. 2.4 The principles contained within this Code also apply to teaching and curriculum content. 3. Principles 3.1 The School operates with a strong presumption in favour of free speech. 3.2 In accordance with the above, the following are two of the most relevant values, which are enshrined in Article 13 of the School ’s Articles of Association: 13.3 Every individual associated with the School shall be entitled to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and to hold opinions without interference, disability or disadvantage, and to freedom of expression and speech within the law, including the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds. 13.4 Academic staff shall have freedom within the law to question and test received wisdom, and to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions, without placing them in jeopardy of losing their jobs or privileges. 3.3 Freedom of academic enquiry, thought and speech underpins everything we do at LSE. These freedoms are fundamental to our founding purpose to ‘understand the causes of things’ and we are proud to be a diverse, global community who come together to explore, study and discuss a wide range of issues through our academic research, educational practices and rigorous debate. We want to provide an environment where ideas are discussed and debated freely and openly within the law. 3.4 The School provides a wide range of fora where free and frank intellectual exchanges take place. Within this both the diverse views of individuals are tolerated, as are the voices of those who wish to peacefully protest. This is central to our culture and protected in law. 3.5 The School, as an institution, does not take a formal position on political or international issues. 3 Instead, it endeavours to provide a platform to facilitate discourse on contemporary matters by encouraging critical debate, within the law, where the views of all parties are treated with respect. 3.6 Subject to clause 4. 6, the use of the Premises shall not be denied to any individual or body of persons on any ground connected with: a. the beliefs or views of that individual or of any member of that body; or b. the policies or objectives of that body except if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that unlawful activity is likely to occur. 3.7 The School assumes that exposure of students to course materials, and statements made, and views expressed by a person as part of teaching, research or discussions about any subject matter that is connected with the content of a course, are unlikely to constitute harassment, unle ss otherwise demonstrated that these matters do in fact amount to harassment. 4. Legislation 4.1 The Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 places a duty on the School to secure freedom of speech, within the law, for staff, members, students and visiting speakers. 4.2 It also places a duty to secure academic freedom for academic staff. This means freedom within the law to question, and test received wisdom and to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions, without placing themselves at risk of lo sing their jobs or privileges or reducing their likelihood of securing promotion or different jobs at the School for reasons unrelated to their academic performance (as judged by established processes, such as Major Review ). 4.3 Activity may be deemed unlawful under a range of legislative provisions, including but not limited to the Equality Act 2010 (incorporating protected belief, harassment and the public sector equality duty), the Public Order Act 1986 and the Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015. Examples, which are not exhaustive, of unlawful activity include the following: • expression of racial hatred or religious hatred, or incitement to such hatred or to violence or other criminal acts; • direct support of an organisation that is proscribed in the UK; • contravention of counter -terrorism legislation; • breach of the peace; • public order offences; • contravention of health and safety legislation. 4.4 Under the statutory duty derived from the Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015, the School has a legal obligation to consider whether the views to be expressed, or that are likely to be expressed, by a speaker on campus constitute extremist views that risk drawing people into terrorism or are shared by terrorist groups; and in such circumstances not to allow Events to proceed exc ept where the School is entirely convinced that such risk can be fully mitigated without cancellation of the Event. However, the Counter Terrorism and Security Act and the statutory duty do not in any way change the definition of free speech within the law or presumption in favour of free speech within the law. Support for or promotion of terrorism is already illegal under previous legislation and as such the School will not allow it to take place on the Premises. 4.5 The expression of views which are unpopular, controversial or provocative or which cause offence does not, if lawful, constitute grounds for the refusal or cancellation of an Event or an invited speaker. 4.6 The School reserves the right to impose such conditions upon the use of the Premises as are 4 reasonably necessary for the discharge of its obligations relating to the safety and health of its registered students, employees and other persons lawfully upon the Premises or for the efficient conduct and administration of its functions. Conditions for Events may include, for example, restrictions on access by those outside the School, or the provision of appropriate security. Event organisers may be required, in exceptional circumstances, to meet the cost of conditions required; however, the School will endeavour to help from central budgets if funding is unavailable. 4.7 The School reserves the right to decide that practical considerations such as the cost, short notice period or difficulty of providing the necessary level of security may require an Event to be modified, curtailed, postponed or – in exceptional circumstances – cancelled. 5. Interaction with other policies and procedures 5.1 The School must take steps that have particular regard to the importance of freedom of speech. In undertaking work to achieve this objective it will need to consider other duties and matters. 5.2 The duties and obligations arising from this Code will be considered in the context of various activity and within relevant policies and procedures, including but not limited to HR policies for academic staff and the Discrimination, Bullying and Harass ment Policy. 6. Procedures in respect of Events 6.1 Advance booking of at least ten working days is required for most School venues which are suitable for Events. Most bookings are handled by Room Bookings in Estates Division. However, venues controlled by LSE Residences or the Faith Centre should be booked directly with those units. Other venues in the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre should be booked through the Students' Union. Departmental meeting rooms and similar should be booked with their owners. Extensive g uidance for Event organis ers is available on the School website. 6.2 The organisers of any Event for which a venue is booked through Room Bookings are required to appoint an individual, who must be a registered student booking on behalf of a registered SU Society or an employee of the School, to act as Principal Organiser of the Event for the purposes of this Code. The Principal Organiser shall be responsible, as far as is reasonably practicable, for ensuring that the organisation of the Event and the conduct of those attending it, whether from the LSE community or outside, is lawful and conforms to the provisions of this Code, to all relevant School guidance and to any condition relating to the Event imposed under this Code. This includes ensu ring that the Event Chair is properly briefed. For the avoidance of doubt, a registered student for the purposes of this Code is a student who is pursuing an undergraduate or postgraduate programme of study for which they are receiving teaching or supervis ion or both. 6.3 In respect of Events for which they handle bookings, Room Bookings will seek advice if necessary on matters related to free speech, in the first instance from the Director of Communications or their nominee. They will seek further advice if necessary, from the Chief Operating Officer or Deputy Chief Operating Officer (who will consult with one of the Vice President & Pro-Vice Chancellors ), especially in cases in which issues of principle in respect of free speech arise, or if it is proposed that access to an Event be significantly modified or curtailed or that it be postponed or cancelled. Any stipulation requiring one or more speakers not to participate in an Event which otherwise goes ahead requires the explicit approval of one of the Vice President & Pro-Vice Chancellors. The Vice President & Pro-Vice Chancellor concerned will retain the right to take the final decision in respect of the operation of this Code. 5 6.4 Venue controllers other than Room Bookings have discretion in respect of venues th ey cont rol not to require a Principal Organiser from t he School community, should that be inappropriate. However, all venue controllers shall similarly be responsible, as far as is reasonably practicable, for ensuring that the organisation of the Event and the conduct of those attending it, whe ther from the LSE community or outside, are lawful and conform to the provisions of this Code and to all relevant School guidance, including in respect of any cond itions the School may require to be met. This includes en suring that the Chair is properly briefed. If advice on free speech matters is need ed, venue cont rollers should contact the Director of Co mmunications, who will if necessary escalate the issue as set out in the previous paragraph. 6.5 The School's Head of Security, or their nominee, will provide security risk management advice to Event organisers. Where it is identified that an Event poses a security risk to any person, facility or business process, the Head of Security or their no minee can be requested to provide or coordinate security arrangements for the Event. They will act as the main point of contact for any necessary dealings with the police. In addition, where security- related decisions need to be taken at very short notice – such as immediately prior to an Event or where an Event is under way - the Head of Security or their nominee has delegated authority to cancel, postpone or close an Event, or impose whatever restrictions are necessary to ensure security, safety and the maintenance of good order. They will normally do so in consultation with the Event Chair, as long as circumstances allow. 6.6 For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, security and safety risks are defined as risks to the life or physical health of any person, or of damage to the Premises, or of theft of or damage to property, or of disruption of an Event to the point at which good order is threatened. Examples of contravention of good order are given at paragraph 6.1 3 below. 6.7 The Head of Security or their nominee has authority over the conduct of all security activity conducted on the Premises. Normally only LSE Security and officially -retained contractors may conduct security activity on the Premises. The presence of any e xternal security organisation on the Premises and their role and conduct while on the Premises must be authorised by the Head of Security or their nominee. 6.8 In considering whether or not to allow a particular event to take place under its authority, the School (and in the first instance this responsibility sits with the Principal Organiser of the Event) has to consider whether the activity may be unlawful (see paragraph 4. 3 above). 6.9 In accordance with the functioning of academic freedom and freedom of speech, individuals are required to behave in a way which enables staff, students or visitors to access any teaching class or event, or their immediate vicinity, and allows them to hear a speaker and contribute to discussion, including questioning the views of those participating in the class or event. 6.10 Where there are concerns about an event or an associated protest the School must consider how risks can be managed or mitigated. 6.11 The School reserves the right to impose such conditions upon the use of the Premises as are reasonably necessary for the discharge of its obligations relating to the safety, health and welfare of its registered students, employees and other persons lawfully up on the Premises or for the efficient conduct and administration of its functions. Conditions for Events may include, for example, restrictions on access by those outs ide the School, or the provision of appropriate security. Event organisers will in principle be required to meet the cost of conditions required; however, the School will always endeavour to help from central budgets if funding is unavailable. 6.12 The School reserves the right to decide that practical considerations such as the cost, short notice period or difficulty of providing the necessary level of security may require an Event to be modified, curtailed, postponed or – in exceptional circumstances – cancelled. The withholding 6 or withdrawal of permission will only occur in exceptional circumstances where measures cannot be put in place to secure freedom of speech within the law and wherever possible after consultation with the principal contact and appropriate internal and exter nal parties as are deemed appropriate by the School. 6.13 Everyone who organises, speaks at or attends an Event at LSE is required to observe good order. Good order includes, but is not limited to, refraining from the following: • preventing participants from accessing or leaving Events safely; • preventing speakers from being heard clearly; • chanting or using foul or abusive language, including racial abuse; • refusing reasonable requests from an Event Chair, Event steward or other LSE staff involved in managing an Event; • displaying flags, banners, placards or similar items in an Event • throwing any item; • acting in any other way which is threatening or abusive, or which denies to others their right to legal free speech. 6.14 Nobody who has exercised their right to legal free speech should suffer censure as a result. 6.15 It is the responsibility of the Event Chair to ensure that anyone who wishes to challenge or criticise the views of the speaker(s) in an orderly fashion is allowed to do so. 6.16 Events that are open to others than current LSE staff or students should always be chaired by a suitable and experienced figure who is fully familiar with the School, meaning in principle an established (not visiting) or emeritus member of the LSE ac ademic staff. Any exceptions to this should be approved by one of the Vice President & Pro-Vice Chancellor s. This may be requested even for a limited access event if appropriate. 6.17 The primary duty of the Event Chair at all School events is to uphold freedom of speech within the law. This means that the Event Chair must adhere at all times to the School’s Code of Practice on Free Speech. The Event Chair also has important respo nsibilities in maintaining good order at events, and must follow the relevant School guidelines. Chairs at LSE events should therefore always act impartially in their facilitation of discussion and debate. 6.18 At Events where discussion is likely to be highly polarised and provoke especially strong feelings and responses, Chairs should take particular care to ensure that they act impartially and that they are seen to do so. At Events of this type, Chairs ma y pose questions to the speaker(s) but should not be a speaker at the Event themselves or be expressing their own views on the subject matter of the Event. Chairs for events of this type must be willing to undertake the relevant preparation, in coordinatio n with the support of relevant School staff, in the run up to the event. 6.19 SMC reserves the right to reject a proposed Event Chair and require event organisers to find a different Event Chair, but only if the proposed Event Chair is not a suitable and experienced figure who is fully familiar with the School or if there is ev idence to provide reasonable grounds to believe that the proposed Event Chair has not acted impartially when chairing previous Events or has not upheld freedom of speech at previous Events. Imposing a change of Chair requires the explicit approval of one o f the Vice President & Pro-Vice Chancellors, and the reasons for it must be communicated in written form to the Event organiser. 6.20 An appeal by any LSE student or staff member against a decision made by the School’s staff at the level of Vice President & Pro Vice Chancellor or Chief Operating Officer or below may be made, within ten working days, to the President & Vice Chancellor. The decision of the President & Vice Chancellor shall be final. 7 7. Complaints 7.1 Any contravention of or departure from the provisions of this Code may render the individual(s) responsible liable to the appropriate sanctions or disciplinary procedures of the School. 7.2 The School will ensure appropriate procedures are in place for members of the School community to raise concerns, and where applicable, formal complaints in relation to their rights to free speech and academic freedom. 7.3 The School will ensure that the appropriate procedures are in place in order to allow its stakeholders to report any concerns to be investigated promptly and thoroughly. 8 Relevant Policies, Guidance and Forms Policies and Regulations for Events (including Room Booking Policy, Health and Safety Policy, Prevent Duty) Good Practice Guidance for Events Room Bookings for Staff LSESU Society Room Bookings Free Speech Complaints Procedure – [To be added once completed] Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years November 2026 April 2026 The Code will also be reviewed and updated as the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 is implemented.

       "  'text': '1 Policy Statement: Disclosure and Barring Service General principles LSE uses the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to help assess the suitability of applicants when recruiting to positions that are likely to involve working with children or vulnerable adults, or other positions of trust. Therefore, LSE will comply fully with the DBS Code of Practice regarding the correct storage, handling, usage, retention and disposal of information obtained through DBS checks. All applicants who require a DBS check will be made aware of the Code of Practice during the recruitment process and will be provided with a copy on request. This policy statement will be made available to all d isclosure applicants at the outset of the recruitment process through LSE’s website. LSE also complies fully with its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant legislation regarding the safe handling, use, storage, retention and disposal of such information. LSE has a written policy on these matters which is available on request. An application for a DBS check will only be submitted to the DBS where a check has been identified in advance as necessary for the posit ion. In such cases, the recruitment information related to the position will include a statement that an application for a DBS check will need to be submitted if the applicant is offered the position. Storage and access Disclosure information is kept se curely, in lockable, non -portable, storage containers with access strictly controlled and limited to those who are entitled to see it as part of their duties. Handling In accordance with secti on 124 of the Police Act 1997, d isclosure information is only passed to those who are authorised to receive it in the course of their duties. LSE maintain s a record of all those to whom disclosures or d isclosure information has been revealed and it is a criminal offence to pass this info rmation to anyone who is not entitled to receive it. Usage Disclosure information is only used for the specific purpose for which it was requested and for which the applicant’s full consent has been given. LSE undertakes to discuss any matter revealed on a DBS certificate with the individual seeking the position before withdrawing a conditional offer of employment, should this be necessary. 2 In line with the Code of Practice, LSE undertakes to treat all applicants fairly. LSE will not discriminate unfair ly against any subject of a DBS check on the basis of a conviction or other information revealed. LSE will ensure that every recruitment decision related to DBS checks or other safeguarding concerns will be overseen by an individual who has been suitably trained to identify and assess the relevance and circumstances of any offences disclosed. LSE will also ensure that appropriate guidance and training has been provided in the relevant legislation relating to the employment of ex -offenders, e.g. the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. LSE has a written policy on the recruitment of ex -offenders which is available on request. Retention Once a recruitment (or other relevant) decision has been made, LSE will not keep any information disclosed through a DBS check for any longer than is necessary. This is generally for a period of up to six months, to allow for the consideration and resolution of any disputes or complaints where relevant. Where exceptional circumstances make it necessary to keep such information for longer than six months, LSE will consult with the DBS, give full consideration to GDPR and the individual’ s human rights, and will inform the individual before making a decision. Throughout this time, the usual conditions for safe storage and strictly controlled access will apply. Disposal Once the retention period has elapsed, LSE will ensur e that any information disclosed as part of a DBS check is immediately destroyed by secure means. While awaiting destruction, the information will not be kept in any insecure receptacle (e.g. waste bin or confidential waste sack). LSE will not keep any pho tocopy or other image of the information or any copy or representation of the contents of a DBS check. However, notwithstanding the above, LSE may keep a record of the date of issue of a Disclosure, the name of the subject, the type of Disclosure requeste d, the position for which the Disclosure was requested, the unique reference number of the Disclosure and the details of the recruitment decision taken.

       "  'text': '1 Introduction Graduate Teaching Assistants, Guest Teachers and Emeritus Teachers are normally members of staff contracted by the School to teach a small number of hours on one or two courses. As such, they are issued with a fractional part -time contract which sets out details of the courses they ar e to teach, their salary payments and a statement of the Terms and Conditions relating to their appointment. This guidance document has been drafted for both departments recruiting to these roles and employees employed on these contracts. The School use s three separate job titles to reflect an employee’s status. Departments should ensure that these are used consistently: \\uf0a7 Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) : for those class teachers who are LSE registered students, issued on a fixed -term basis due to the developmental nature of these roles, up to a maximum of four years. GTA contracts are intended to run concurrently with a GTA’s student status. The fixed - term nature of the contract ensures that these roles become vacant to allow other LSE students to gain such experience. \\uf0a7 Emeritus Teacher : for those retired LSE academics who are teaching on an annual, post - retirement contract. \\uf0a7 Guest Teacher (GT) : for any other class teachers and guest lecturers, often external academic experts or professional practitioners who are invited to teach at the School. This job title should also be used for former Graduate Teaching Assistants who are no longer LSE registered students. Guest Teacher contracts should follow the normal fixed -term contract guidance1. If you are recruiting one of these posts and you are unsure of the type of contract to offer, please contact HR Operations team. The Fixed -Term Employees (prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 ensures that staff employed on fixed -term con tracts are not treated less favourably than staff on open -ended contracts. The onus is placed on employers to justify why staff are being renewed or re -engaged after four years and not moved to open -ended contracts. 1 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/Assets/Internal/staff/AtoZ/FTCs.pdf Guidance for the Employment of Graduate Teaching Assistants, Guest Teachers and Emeritus Teachers for Departments and Staff Academic 2 Employers need to demonstrate that the re is an objective justification for the contract to remain fixed - term. The objective of the legislation is to ensure that employers do not abuse the use of fixed -term contracts and in particular do not use the expiry of a fixed -term contract as a means of dismissing an individual for performance reasons. T herefore, the School uses fixed -term contracts only in very limited circumstances: \\uf0a7 Covering staff absence e.g. maternity/paternity/adoption leave, sabbatical, buy -out leave or secondments; \\uf0a7 career develop ment; \\uf0a7 for particular limited projects where specialist expertise or skills are needed. Where a GTA or GT becomes pregnant during the course of their teaching, or wishes to take a period of adoption leave or shared parental leave, the planned absence does not constitute a reason for not renewing the individual’s contract. In such cases, the employing department should consult with HR to ensure that the individual’s employment rights are preserved. Principles \\uf0a7 The Academic and Student Affairs Committee and the Undergraduate and Graduate Studies Sub-Committees jointly recognise the value of contributions made by the GTAs and GTs who contribute to teaching across all departments and subject areas. \\uf0a7 When undertaking teaching and associated duties GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs have the same responsibility as other teaching staff for maintaining the standards, quality of teaching and learning in addition to enhancing the international reputation of the LSE. The School must therefore ensure that these staff have the appropriate level of support and that there are adequate quality assurances in place to secure a professional and high quality service. In particular, they must ensure the Code of Good Practice is adhered to. \\uf0a7 MSc students should not be employed as GTAs, other than in exceptional circumstances and with permission from the Chair of the Graduate Studies Sub -Committee. For a contract to be issued, confirmation that the necessary permission has been sought from the Chair of the Graduate Studies Sub -Committee will be required. Please contact the Teaching Quality Assurance and Review Office at ard.capis@lse.ac.uk to request Graduate Studies Sub - Committee Chair’s consideration for GTA teaching or assessment d uties at graduate level. \\uf0a7 GTAs who are registered PhD students should not teach MSc students other than in cases where the PhD student is near to completion2 and have specialist expertise of direct relevance to the course they teach. In such cases, the Chair of the Graduate Studies Sub -Committee must give their approval. Please contact the Teaching Quality Assurance and Review Office at ard.capis@lse.ac.uk to request Graduate Studies Sub -Committee Chair’s consideration for GTA teaching or assessment duties at graduate level. \\uf0a7 LSE-registered PhD students employed as GTAs should seek the permission of their research supervisor(s) prior to accepting the contract. The onus is on the research student to obtain these permission(s). For a contract to be issued, confirmation that the nec essary permission has been sought from the research supervisor(s) will be required. Departments should monitor this locally. 2 Near to completion is defined as post submission of the t hesis for the viva. 3 \\uf0a7 Where departments opt to employ research students from other institutions, due consideration should be given to the appropriatene ss of any support/training they have received elsewhere, as well as to the training they will need to work at LSE. Research students from other institutions should be employed as GTs rather than GTAs. \\uf0a7 This guidance should be included with contracts iss ued to GTAs and Guest Teachers. It is also sent to departmental managers by HR at the beginning of each session for circulation within departments. In particular, departmental managers are asked to ensure that the guidance is circulated to all academic s taff within departments responsible for courses on which GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs are employed to teach. Contracts of employment GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs should be issued with contracts on a termly or yearly basis, according to the teaching needs of each department. These contracts should be created by departments and issued by HR. GTA contracts are offered to LSE students on a fixed -term basis as a career development post. The purpose of such posts is to enable post holders to gain experie nce necessary to move on to other teaching and academic positions. A GTA contract will not be extended beyond an individual’s registration as an LSE student. The contract will cease at the end of the final academic year in which the individual is registere d as an LSE student. Other teachers, who are not LSE students, may be employed as GTs or Emeritus Teachers on termly or yearly contracts, according to the teaching requirements of each department. Where such teachers have more than four years’ continuous service they shall be issued with a contract without an expiry date, unless there is another valid reason to justify the issue of a further fixed -term contract. See “Contracts of Employment” on the HR website3 for further information. The fraction of the contract shall normally be determined according to the formula set out in Section 5.2, i.e. the number of different courses and classes taught. The fractional contract shall include time for actual teaching contact hours, preparation and marking, office ho urs, lecture attendance (where this is required) and administration; exam marking, however, shall be paid separately. Departments may deviate from the standard formula where the particular delivery requirements of a course necessitate this, but they must m ake clear the reasons for doing so. It is recommended that each department sets out its own policy on the pay of GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs. Entitlement to work in the United Kingdom and other restrictions Prevention of Illegal Working Regulations and Work Permits As an employer, LSE has a duty to prevent illegal working. The LSE has a statutory duty to ensure that all employees can demonstrate that they have the right to work in the UK for the duration of their contracts and before they start their em ployment and for the duration of their contracts. It is illegal to employ someone aged 16 or over who is subject to immigration control if they are not allowed to undertake the work in question. In addition, it is a criminal offence for an individual to w ork 3 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/Assets/Internal/staff/AtoZ/Types -of-contract.pdf 4 illegally in the UK. Conducting a Right to Work check ensures that LSE has a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty. This means that if the UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) find that the School has employed someone who does not have the right to work, but it has correctly conducted document checks as required, the School will not receive a civil penalty for employing the illegal worker. If LSE fails to carry out these checks correctly, or at all, and the School is found to be employing someone illegally, the UKVI will take tough action. LSE could face a large financial penalty known as a civil penalty of up to £20,000 for each illegal worker, or up to 2 years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine if an illegal worker is knowingly employ ed. In addition, the sponsorship licence for staff could be revoked. This would mean that LSE would no longer be able to sponsor any new staff on Tier 2 and Tier 5 and all existing staff on Tier 2 or Tier 5 would need to leave our employment with immediate effect. In addition, the School’s Tier 4 licence for students would be affected, which would affect LSE’s ability to sponsor overseas students. All employees and potential employees require a Right to Work check before undertaking any employment at the L SE. This includes new employees and those who have worked at LSE previously and are returning after a break in employment. A Right to Work check is the process by which an individual’s original passport and/or visa is checked by the employer to ensure th at it is valid, appropriate copies are taken, signed and verified as true copies and retained on the employee’s HR file. A Right to Work check is conducted by the HR Division before the person undertakes any work and by no later than 9.30am on their first day. Please refer to the School’s Immigration Policy4 for further information on Right to Work. Staff already employed as full -time or part -time academics, LSE fellows or Teaching Fellows Staff already employed as full -time or fractional full -time academ ics or tutorial staff must not be employed as Graduate Teaching Assistants, Emeritus Teachers or Guest Teachers, since any teaching duties are included within their full -time contract. If part -time staff work hours in excess of their contract, for example to cover a course, these should be remunerated by completion of a staff Claim for Payment form available from HR. Where full -time staff teach for departments other than their ‘home’ department, it is up to the departments to agree between themselves an a ppropriate transfer of funds. Additional working hours restriction for LSE students LSE students are generally restricted to a total of 20 hours of work per week in term -time to enable them to focus on their studies. However, students may be allowed to work extra hours if the department with which they are registered as a student is agre eable and their visa allows this. Agreement must be sought in writing and before the hours are worked. It is important to remember that many students have multiple appointments and may work for more than one department. If you are employing a student, ple ase check the number of hours that they are working with both the student and HR. If an individual is an LSE student, please give brief details of their course on the contract template, e.g. MSc Government, PhD Philosophy, MPhil/PhD International Relation s. 4 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and-procedures/Assets/Documents/immPol.pdf 5 As noted, students may hold multiple contracts; however they are responsible for ensuring that they do not work more than their permitted hours and they should take appropriate steps to reduce their hours if they are deemed excessive. Although Tier 4 visa restrictions mean that Tier 4 students can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week during term -time, the general restrictions stated in this document will also still apply. PhD students and 1 year Masters students who have Tier 4 visas do not have a summer vacation and are not permitted to work full -time during this period. Working more than 20 hours per week during term -time on a Tier 4 visa constitutes a breach of visa conditions and individuals will be liable for either a financial penalty, impri sonment or deportation if found to be doing so by the UKVI. If a student believes that they are eligible to work full -time on their Tier 4 visa, they should provide evidence to the HR Division before undertaking additional hours. Accepted evidence is eith er: a) A letter from their university on headed paper stating the student’s term dates and confirming that the student is on a formal vacation period, or; b) a letter from their university on headed paper confirming that the student has completed all course req uirements and so is eligible to work full -time. Please contact HR if you have any queries about w orking at the School on a Tier 4 visa. Rates of pay Teacher salary bands Teachers should be paid on a salary band which reflects the tasks and responsibilities of the role they are filling. Graduate Teaching Assistants shall usually be employed on Band 5 to reflect their duties, although some may undertake work at, and thus be paid at Band 6. Guest Teachers shall be employed at an appropriate sal ary band if matched against appropriate teaching -only academic role profiles (typically Band 7 if lecturing, but potentially up to Band 10, or at Bands 5 or 6 if undertaking the same duties as Graduate Teaching Assistants). The current salary scales can be found on the relevant webpage5. When determining the initial placement of a new GTA /GT on the appropriate salary band, the individual’s relevant previous experience should be taken into account. GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs shall benefit from the same incremental progression rules as apply to all other members of staff. Hours for delivering teaching The standard contractual hours for a GTA appointment shall be built up as follows: Contact hours Actual teaching contract time in hours (i.e. weeks x groups x length of seminar) 5 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/Working -for-LSE/LSE -Salary -Scales?from_serp=1 6 Preparation 2 hours per different course taught (i.e. weeks x courses x 2) Lecture attendance and meetings Actual hours* (i.e. weeks x courses) Office Hours 1 office hour per 3 groups** (i.e. weeks x groups / 3) Formative marking (Qualitative subjects) 4 items per student per course; 3 items marked per hour (i.e. 4 x groups x 15 / 3)*** Reports and Registers 0.5 hours per student per full unit per year (i.e. groups x 15 x 0.5) *Lecture attendance: departments shall adopt a clear policy as to when lecture attendance is compulsory for pedagogic reasons (e.g. for new teachers or where syllabuses have changed significantly); where attendance is policy, this must be paid. Similarly attendance at regular meetings, for example w ith a course co -ordinator, shall be paid. **Departments are encouraged to distribute office hours over the year according to student demand (e.g. possibly not holding office hours at the start of the year, but holding extra ones before exam periods). It i s recognised that lack of physical space in some departments may require alternative arrangements to be made. ***Based on four items of 1500 word length. Marking regimes are highly variable between courses, so local arrangements may apply. This is particu larly the case for departments such as Mathematics which have weekly homework. However departments must ensure that their policies on paying for marking are justified, transparent and rational compared with School practice. HR should be advised if any ch anges are made to the standard method of deriving hours on the contract template. Please notify HR of any changes and the reason(s) when emailing completed individual contracts or groups of contracts to HR. The fraction shall be based on the standard LSE working week of 35 hours, with the standard holiday entitlement, included in the rate paid, for full -time staff of 41 days a year, i.e. 25 days’ annual leave, eight School closure days and eight public holidays. The same principles should apply to GTs an d Emeritus Teachers in determining their pay and ensuring equal pay for work of equal value. The above model could be used as a basis, but it is anticipated that the model will need to be adapted at an individual contract level depending on the requirement of the appointment (depending on the extent, for instance, to which the teacher is involved in the development of a course). Additional pay for exam marking and other duties paid as overtime As with formative marking time which is paid within the standard contract, departments should devise a clear policy setting out an agreed average number of scripts to be marked per hour for each type of exam script. All teachers in the same department should then be paid consistently. Departments do not have to pay s taff for actual hours worked, as long as a consistent and reasonable amount of time per script has been allowed. Exam and essay marking can be paid as overtime to those with existing class teacher contracts. If the amount of summative marking is known in advance and you wish to add it to a teacher contract, please set up a line with the course title of “summative marking”, enter the required amount of hours in the marking box and set all other boxes on the line to zero. 7 If the GTA or GT has left the payr oll and will work 35 hours or less for a period of not more than a month, a blue casual payment form should be used. A new contract should be set up if the work is expected to be for more than 35 hours or more than a month. For current GTAs or GTs on the p ayroll, the green overtime form should be used. It may be helpful to set up the contract end date to go beyond the teaching end date so that marking can be added on at a later stage. For example, if a teacher taught Lent Term only but had some marking in S ummer Term, then enter the date until the end of Summer Term. Department managers will need to make sure that the teacher is still currently on LSE’s payroll. If the teacher has left, they will need to go to HR with their Right to Work documents before co mmencing the work. The employee details form will also need to be completed and submitted to confirm their personal details, including the tax declaration. Creating and Issuing Contracts – Advice for Departments Teacher template \\uf0a7 Contracts should be created using the Excel electronic template, which can be found on the in the Recruitment Toolkit on the HR website6. \\uf0a7 When all fields have been completed, save the template with a name e.g. \"Smith_J – GTA - 2018.xls\" and email to hr.pay.hourly@lse.ac.uk. \\uf0a7 There is no need to print out terms and conditions documents – these will be issued separately by HR. \\uf0a7 To ensure timely payment, completed contracts should reach HR Division by the published contract deadline7 for the month in which the contract commences. Do remember that Right to Work checks can cause delays in the processing of contracts. \\uf0a7 It is particularly important that contracts reach HR as early as possible. Campus and Library access, borrowing rights etc. are dependent on holding a valid LSE ID Card. Teachers who are not already a member of staff or student at the LSE will therefore have di fficulties gaining access to the campus until their contract has been processed. Checking funding \\uf0a7 If the contract funding page is showing a total cost of over £15 000.00, the contract will need to be sent to the appropriate financial manager in the Finance Division. If the contract is being paid out of a research budget, the Research Division will need to approve the contract for the total amount. Issuing contracts \\uf0a7 Upon receiving new contracts HR will fill in the continuous service date ( do not complete thi s yourself ) and check the details of the contract and the funding. 6 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/The -Recruitment -Toolkit 7 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Finance -Division/assets/documents/internal/staff/payroll/Payroll - deadlines -2018.pdf 8 \\uf0a7 HR will issue appointees’ contracts and terms and conditions via email. If the appointee is a new starter or is being re -employed on the system, an employee details form will also be attac hed. These two forms may be signed electronically and returned by email. The appointee will also be instructed if necessary to bring their Right to Work documents to the HR reception in 5th Floor, LRB. \\uf0a7 Payment cannot be made until the Right to Work checks have been completed and the signed acceptance copy has been received by HR. \\uf0a7 In the event of a course being cancelled at short notice and there being no alternative teaching available, GTAs and GTs will be paid four weeks’ salary to compensate for the pre paration work that will have been undertaken in advance of the course beginning. Contract amendments \\uf0a7 As the fractional salary is based on the expected teaching workload specified in the contract, overpayment will result if fewer hours are worked. Depar tments must inform HR of any variation from the contracted hours to avoid overpayment or underpayment. \\uf0a7 Payment for additional hours can be claimed using an overtime form. Casual appointments \\uf0a7 If you want to make a one -off payment to an individual who does not already have a contract as a GTA, Emeritus Teacher or GT in your department, you may use the casual contract. However, if an employee works for 35 hours and/or works for more than a period of one month, the standard, aforementioned procedure should a pply. \\uf0a7 Do note that in accordance with the School’s Financial Regulations8 (section C13.3), all staff should be employed on the School’s standard rates of pay. \\uf0a7 Do refer to the Recruitment Toolkit9 for more information on appointing casual staff. Unusual payments or working arrangements \\uf0a7 As far as possible and in accordance with the School’s Financial Regulations, the standard contract template should be used for all payments to teachers. Please contact the relevant HR Partner for advice if you believe that a particular set of circumstances are not covered by the standard teacher contract. Self-Employed (Schedule D) Payments \\uf0a7 Please note that it is highly unlikely that the Inspector of Taxes will agree to payment under self-employed (Schedule D) for any form of teaching at LSE. 8 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and-procedures/Assets/Documents/finReg.pdf 9 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/The -Recruitment -Toolkit 9 \\uf0a7 However, if a teacher wishes to discuss their tax status, please refer them to the Payroll email: Fin.Div.Payroll@lse.ac.uk \\uf0a7 N.B. If you know that a teacher working for you has been gra nted self -employed (Schedule D) status, DO NOT complete a standard contract. The standard contract is a contract of employment, whereas self -employed staff should be issued with a contract for services. Again, do contact Payroll10 for advice. \\uf0a7 Sometimes t eaching is carried out by people employed by other institutions that then invoice the LSE for their employees\\' services. Please pass such invoices directly to Finance Division, having counter -signed them and put the correct cost code on the invoice. \\uf0a7 If you have any general queries about the administration of particular teacher contracts please contact the Hourly and Casual Contracts team hr.pay.hourly@lse.ac.uk Course Details \\uf0a7 Faculties are responsible for org anising the class programmes for their courses, liaising with class teachers to ensure that the classes are properly coordinated with their lectures, and submitting course reading lists to the Library in good time for required books to be purchased. \\uf0a7 All information about the course to be taught or series of lectures or seminars should be provided to the teacher by the faculty member in charge of the course sufficiently far in advance to allow adequate preparation. The faculty member responsible for t he course will direct the work of the teacher and discuss any questions they may have, e.g. the level of attainment to be assumed by the students or the relationship of their work to their course as a whole. \\uf0a7 All details of times and venues will be suppl ied by the Timetables Office in advance of the start of the contract. Class teachers with specific access needs should contact the Timetables Office in advance to ensure that the rooms allocated are suitable. Assessment Formative assessment \\uf0a7 Marking student coursework, providing formative feedback to students and completing class registers are all standard duties for the vast majority of class teachers and are key to monitoring student progress; this includes informing course tutors and/or aca demic advisers where class teachers may have concerns about student performance. It is very important that these duties and responsibilities are discharged with due rigor and attention. \\uf0a7 Class teachers should be briefed clearly about departmental academi c standards. This is best achieved either by a formal marking exercise for new class teachers or moderation of early marking by the lecturer(s) responsible for courses employing GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs. 10 https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisio ns/Finance -Division/payroll 10 \\uf0a7 Class teachers should also be given clear de partmental guidance on plagiarism and advice on the extent to which collaborative work on in -course tasks is encouraged or discouraged. \\uf0a7 In accordance with the Code of Practice, GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs will be expected to provide feedback to studen ts within three weeks of submission of the work concerned. Summative A ssessment \\uf0a7 Any GTAs, Emeritus Teachers or GTs employed to mark examination scripts or other student work that contribute towards the student’s final degree award should have this work covered by a separate contract; they should be briefed appropriately on the relevan t regulations on examination marking and provided with a copy of the Instructions to Examiners for Undergraduate and Taught Graduate Programmes issued by the Academic Registrar’s Division. \\uf0a7 At graduate level, the sub -board chair must approve any GTA or G T appointment as an examiner. \\uf0a7 It would be highly exceptional for GTAs or GTs who are also registered as PhD students to act as examiners for graduate level assessments. In such cases, the Chair of the GSSC must give their approval and the student concerne d would normally need to be near completion and/or would have specialist expertise of direct relevance to the course concerned. Please contact the Teaching Qu ality Assurance and Review Office at ard.capis@lse.ac.uk to request Graduate Studies Sub -Committee Chair’s consideration for GTA teaching or assessment duties at graduate level.” Office Hours \\uf0a7 Departments are asked to ensure that teachers are made aware of the following good practice guidance concerning off ice hours which has been endorsed by the Academic Board. \\uf0a7 All staff should hold at least one office hour per week during term time, before examinations begin and during reading weeks as per the department’s norm. Where more than three groups are taught a week, one or more additional office hours should be held (i.e. for four, five or six groups, two office hours should be held; for seven, eight or nine groups, three office hours should be held). However, departments may arrange these more flexibly at peak times, for example, by reducing them to every two weeks in the Michaelmas Term and increasing them when work is due to be submitted and/or before examinations. \\uf0a7 Office hours should be: \\uf0b7 Timed on the half hour (e.g. 2.30pm – 3.30pm) to minimise the potential of timetable clashes and to make them more accessible to students; \\uf0b7 Advertised electronically (e.g. on the department’s web pages or in Moodle) in addition to more traditional methods; \\uf0b7 Managed more effectively by making use of the LSE For You booking syst em; \\uf0b7 Organised separately for advisees and for taught students, and their purpose made clear. 11 Departmental and School communications \\uf0a7 It is important that departments acknowledge that class teachers are staff within the department and should therefore be included in the life of the department. Heads of Department should ensure that teachers receive an appropriate induction to the depart ment. \\uf0a7 Heads of Department are responsible for ensuring that all teachers understand the level of liaison and co -operation required with other colleagues for the effective running of the department and the quality delivery of the particular course. \\uf0a7 Heads of Department may nominate at least one member of full -time staff to act as an adviser to all GTAs, Emeritus Teachers and GTs in their department. The role of the adviser should be to: \\uf0b7 Ensure that teachers receive a comprehensive departmental induct ion and are made fully aware of staff development requirements and opportunities; \\uf0b7 Ensure that teachers are kept fully informed of relevant meetings, events, support opportunities and other departmental matters; \\uf0b7 Provide support as necessary where communica tions between class teachers and course conveners are problematic; \\uf0b7 Follow through the results of monitoring exercises undertaken with teachers, advising them and/or referring them as appropriate, e.g. to the Teaching and Learning Centre (TLC). Use of Equipment and Facilities \\uf0a7 Heads of Department are responsible for ensuring that class teachers are provided with an appropriate work space and computer access in order to be able to undertake administrative tasks to support their teaching. Heads of Department are also responsible for ensuring that class teachers are provided with appropriate space for office hours and teaching preparation; this may involve providing class teachers with details of how to book suitable rooms. \\uf0a7 Heads of Department are also respons ible for ensuring that class teachers are fully aware of their obligations in the workplace in relation to: \\uf0b7 Use of equipment and premises \\uf0b7 Student welfare reporting lines \\uf0b7 Health and safety at work \\uf0b7 School and local arrangements for business continuity planning \\uf0a7 Heads of Department should ensure that teachers are provided with appropriate information at the start of the contract about central School services – e.g. Learning Technology and Innovation (LTI), audio -visual and reprographic services. Perfo rmance Monitoring \\uf0a7 The faculty member overseeing the course will be responsible for monitoring the class teacher’s performance. 12 \\uf0a7 It is recommended that a teaching observation is carried out for all class teachers in their first year of teaching. \\uf0a7 All cl ass teaching is ‘quality controlled’ by the Michaelmas class teacher survey which is School -wide. The Head of Department (or their nominee) should ensure that the Michaelmas Term data is properly reviewed and acted on, with assistance from TLC as appropri ate, and that any concerns related to teaching quality that are raised by students are speedily and properly investigated. \\uf0a7 Wherever possible, the decision on continuation for class teachers with no previous teaching experience in the department should be based on feedback from students (e.g. via School student survey returns) as well as from at least one observation of the tea cher in action by a full-time faculty member. \\uf0a7 The Head of Department (or adviser to teachers) should provide teachers with feedback on the results of the School student survey. Where appropriate, teachers should be guided on any necessary areas for devel opment and encouraged to make appropriate use of support available from the Teaching and Learning Centre. \\uf0a7 Questionnaire results, along with a note of any action required, should be held on the personal file for each teacher held by the Head of Departmen t. Staff Development \\uf0a7 All GTAs are expected to attend initial training on teaching and learning in their first year of appointment. Contracts for subsequent years may be withheld if training has not been undertaken. \\uf0a7 Other fractional teaching appointees who lack teaching experience may also be required to attend an introductory workshop. All appropriate teachers will be paid to attend central training of up to six half days at a fixed rate per half day. Experienced t eachers are required to attend any departmental briefings and arrange for a 1 -2-1 meeting with a member of the academic staff development team in the Teaching and Learning Centre (email: tlc@lse.ac.uk ). \\uf0a7 It is recogn ised that teachers have commitments outside the LSE and are appointed for a variety of different reasons and under different circumstances. It is likely that, in many cases, teachers will have received a variety of development and training through their professional channels and other employers. In this context, the primary responsibility for following up any developmental needs identified in the course of employment with the School lies with the individual teacher, with the active support and encouragem ent of their department and the Teaching and Learning Centre. The School’s teaching development programme will be made available to all teachers. Class teachers are actively encouraged to attend staff development events as appropriate to their role. \\uf0a7 In the case of a substantial number of class teachers who are also postgraduate students of the LSE or other institutions, the School recognises its duty to provide more structured training in the interests of both the teaching quality at the School and the professional development of the individual postgraduate teacher. To this end, the School expects that such teachers will attend: \\uf0b7 Departmental induction events/course briefings at the start of each academic session; 13 \\uf0b7 the Deans’ School Induction session, h eld annually at the start of the academic year, in the year they start teaching; \\uf0b7 the School introduction to Teaching and Learning (or an equivalent arranged by the Department) before or during the individual’s first year of teaching. \\uf0a7 Teachers may choose to take their teaching development further and can seek support from the Teaching and Learning Centre. \\uf0a7 For those teachers drawn from the professions external to the School, participation is encouraged but is not compulsory. LSE Han dbook for Graduate Teaching Assistants \\uf0a7 The LSE Handbook for Graduate Teaching Assistants available from the Teaching and Learning Centre provides practical information and insight into teaching and the support of student learning at the LSE.

       "  'text': '1 1. Introduction 1.1 The London School of Economics and Political Science (‘the School’) is committed to embedding equity, diversity and inclusion in all aspects of its culture and facilitating different flexible working options acknowledging the numerous benefits to both the employee and the employer. As part of this the School adopts a ‘Core Business in Core Hours’ Policy. Core hours are defined as the hours between 10.00 and 16.00. 1.2 The School recognises that many colleagues, for work -life balance reasons (for example those with caring responsibilities, but also on other grounds), may be unable to attend essential meetings if they take place too early or too late in the day. Most meetings and particularly regular meetings that deal with the core business of the School and its departments/divisions/centres should take place during core hours, wherever possible. Exceptions to this adv ice are noted in Section 4. 1.3 This policy should be read in conjunction with the School’s broader Flexible Working Policy and Procedure which offers further a dvice on formal and informal flexible working arrangements. 2. Policy aims 2.1 The aims of this policy are: • to promote an inclusive environment in which all people are valued and respected; Core Business in Core Hours Policy Operational 2 • to promote a supportive learning, working and social environment in which everyone feels that they are valued and can work to their full potential; • to ensure that the maximum number of people can attend important meetings, allowing, for example, the widespread dissemination of critical information and avoiding unintend ed exclusion of some staff. 3. Policy principles 3.1 Core regular meetings that colleagues need to attend should normally take place within core hours. This includes, for example, all regular committee meetings, staff meetings, departmental seminars, divisio nal away days and research group meetings. Lunch time meetings, however, should be avoided. 3.2 Regular social events should ideally take place on different days of the week so that all staff, whether part time or full time, have the opportunity to attend.. There is an understandable tendency to hold social events in the late afternoon or early evening, but consideration should be given as to whether such events can occasionally take place during core hours. 3.3 This policy does not apply to teaching. Academic staff are free to arrange their teaching outside core hours. 4. Meetings and events outside core hours 4.1 One- off or occasional events during the academic year can be organised outside core hours, but should be announced with plenty of notice (e.g. at least six weeks) so that colleagues can, for example, arrange replacement care. This includes, for example, research group residential events/courses. 4.2 The established practice for arranging times to meet colleagues and/or students within or beyond core hours is acceptable, as long as this is by the free agreement of the parties involved. 4.3 Meetings can take place outside core hours if participants find this preferable. 4.4 The School acknowledges that there can be occasions (e.g. presentations by job candidates in combination with an interview panel) where the logistics are such that the set of meetings cannot reasonably fit into core hours. 5. Scope and responsibilities 5.1 This policy applies to all staff. This Policy does not, however, apply to meetings that involve lay governors, members of Council or other externals as their own external work commitments may not make it possible for them to attend meetings during core hours. 5.2 The School Management Committee, Heads of Depart ment, Service Leaders and Centre/Institute Directors are responsible for ensuring this policy is applied fairly and consistently and should seek guidance, if necessary. 5.3 All School staff will be made aware of this policy at induction. Details of the policy will also distributed to academic departments, centres, institutes and divisions and be available on the HR website. 6. Monitoring 6.1 The School will take steps to monitor the impact of this policy. 3 Approved by: SMC Date: February 2017 Implementation date: March 2017 Review period: Annual Division: EDI/HR 4 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 123 00/00/00 00/00/00 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 123 00/00/00 abc abc 123 00/00/00 abc abc Links Reference Link 123 abc 123 abc Contacts Position Name Email Notes abc abc abc@lse.ac.uk abc Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \" 1. Introduction and Purpose of Policy 1.1 The purpose of this policy is to promote and maintain fair and equitable recruitment and selection procedures across the School and to ensure consistency in their application. The policy takes cognisance of the governance arrangements of the School as well as the need to ensure the approach enables delivery of the strategic priorities of the School. 1.2 Recruiting the most talented individuals is essential to the ongoing success of the School. Whilst the principal aim of the recruitment task is to get the right person for the right job, selecting individuals who will contribute to an inclusive and stimula ting School community is also important. The School achieves this through transparent, equitable and non - discriminatory policies and procedures, which enable the fair treatment of applicants as well as demonstrating a broader commitment to the principles o f equality and diversity. 1.3 For the purposes of this policy and procedure: • ‘Department’ applies to Departments (including Schools), Research Centres and Institutes. • ‘Head of Department’ applies to Heads of Departments, Heads of School/Dean, Centre Directors and Institute Directors. • ‘Department Manager’ applies to Department Managers, Centre Managers and Institute Managers. 1.4 This Policy provides an overview of the School’s approach. It should be read in conjunction with the Recruitment and Selection Proce dure (Academic, Research and Teaching Appointments). 2. Policy Scope 2.1 This policy applies to the recruitment and selection of the following vacancies: Recruitment and Selection Policy Academic, Research and Teaching Appointments Academic  • Academic - New Academic Career (NAC) o Assistant Professor (SBA1) o Associate Professor (SBA2) o Professor (SBA3) • Research (including New Research Staff Career (NRSC)) o Research Assistant (Band 5) o Research Officer (Band 6) o Research Fellow (Band 7) o Assistant Professorial Research Fellow (SBA1) o Associate Professorial Research Fellow (SBA2) o Professorial R esearch Fellow (SBA3) • Policy Fellows o Policy Officer (Band 6) o Policy Fellow (Band 7) o Senior Policy Fellow (Band 8) o Distinguished Policy Fellow (Band 9) • Teaching (including Education Career Track (ECT)) o Teaching Fellow (Band 5) o Course Tutor (Band 7) o Assistant Professorial Lecturer (SBA1) o Associate Professorial Lecturer (SBA2) o Professorial Lecturer (SBA3) • Senior Lecturers of Practice (Band 8) and Professors of Practice (Band 10) • LSE Fellow (Band 6) • Teaching Fellow (Band 5) 2.2 The School’s policy is to recruit by open selection, unless there is an objective justification for not advertising. For appointments by single nomination, the Single Nomination Policy should be read in conjunction with this policy. 2.3 For appointments of Teaching Fellows and LSE Fellows, the Guidance on employing LSE Fellow s and Teaching Fellows should be read in conjunction with this policy and procedure. 3. Policy Aims 3.1 The common aim of all academic, research and teaching recruitment processes in the School is the successful appointment of the highest quality staff (judged by the standards of the School’s global peers for NAC, NRSC and ECT appointments) through an inclus ive and fair process that has strong Departmental support. The School is therefore committed to hiring outstanding world -class staff based on open, active and global searches that involve and are open to input from existing NAC, NRSC or ECT staff at all gr ades. The School  is also committed to equality and diversity as well as the fair treatment of all applicants who apply for vacancies at the School. 3.2 Recruitment at the School will be fair, transparent and subject to open competition, whether internal or ex ternal, with the consistent aim of identifying and appointing the best candidate for a role on the grounds of merit. 3.3 To ensure a fair process all conflicts of interests must be carefully managed. Therefore, in addition to the School policy, further detailed guidance (provided in section 8) must be followed. 3.4 The School is committed to delivering the recruitment and selection of staff in a professional, timely and responsive manner. All recruitment should be undertaken through the School’s e-Recruitment system. 3.5 All applicants should be considered fairly and consistently, and decisions on an applicant’s suitability for a post are based on how they meet the criteria identified on the published Person Specification for the post. Selection decisions should be explicitly based upon evidence, though the evidence required may differ according to the type of role; CVs, covering letters, writing samples, presentations, int erviews and references are routine. 3.6 The School is part of the Disability Confident Scheme, https://www.lse.ac.uk/int ranet/staff/humanResources/Form Database/Recruitment - Toolkit/internal/Two Ticks Scheme.pdf and commits to interview all disabled candidates who meet the essential criteria listed within the Person Specification for a job vacancy, providing they choose to apply under the ‘Guaranteed Interview Scheme’. 3.7 Where applicants with disabilities require adjustments to the recruitment and selection process, the School will endeavour to pro -actively remove any barriers that it reasona bly can to enable full participation in the process. 4. Policy Principles 4.1 All academic, research and teaching appointments should take account of the following principles: • Legislation, including: Equality Act (2010); General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR 2018); Fix ed-term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations (2002); Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act (2006); Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (1974); and, The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act (2006); • Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy statement; • LSE Ethics Code; • LSE Strategy; • Data Protection legislation – the do’s and the don’t s;  • Identifying, declaring and managing conflicts of interest during the recruitment process; Requirements for compliance with UK immigration legislation. 4.2 To uphold the School’s commitment to equality of respect and opportunity, as set out in the Ethics Code, we will treat all people with dignity and respect, and ensure that no one will be treated less favourably because of: their role at the School; age; disability; ge nder identity; race; religion or belief; sex; sexual orientation; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; social and economic background. 4.3 All documentation relating to applicants will be treated confidentially in accordance with Data Protection legislation R. Applicants will also have the right to access any documentation held about them in accordance with the legislation.

Introduction 1.1 This Procedure provides an overview of the School’s procedure for the selection of academic, research and teaching appointments. It should be read in conjunction with the Recruitment and Selection Policy (Academic, Researc h and Teaching Appointments). 2. Preparation Stage 2.1 The recruiting Department should conduct a full evaluation of the need for the role against their strategic and budgetary plans prior to undertaking any recruitment. The relevant research and/or teaching sp ecialism of posts should be defined as broadly as possible, subject to fulfilment of the strategic need based on the Department obtained approval for the post in question. Positions that become available when an individual leaves a post should not simply b e advertised as a like -for-like replacement, unless doing so is within local strategy and, where applicable, Academic Planning and Resources Committee (APRC) review recommendations. Vacancies that arise are always an opportunity to consider re - orientation of staffing priorities. 2.2 Recruiting Departments are responsible for drafting the advert, job description and person specification and ensuring that these documents are in the correct templates. The advert  must contain the main criteria by which the selecti on for the post will be undertaken. Standardised Job Descriptions exist for the below roles and should not be changed by recruiting Departments. Person specification templates should be amended but only as is necessary for the specific role recruited to. S uch changes should be shared with the Human Resources Adviser and approved by the PDFD and/or VCAC prior to final submission. • Academic (New Academic Career (NAC)) o Assistant Professor ( job description and person specification ) o Associate Professor ( job description and person specification ) o Professor ( job description and person specification ) • Research (including New Research Staff Career (NRSC)) o Research Assistant (job description ) o Research Officer (job description ) o Research Fellow (job description ) o Assistant Professorial Research Fellow (job description and person specification ) o Associate Professorial Research Fellow (job description and person specification ) o Professorial Research Fellow (job description and person specification ) • Policy Fellows o Policy Officer (Band 6) ( role profile ) o Policy Fellow (Band 7) ( role profile ) o Senior Policy Fellow (Band 8) ( role profile ) o Distinguished Policy Fellow (Band 9) ( role profile ) • Teaching (including Education Career Track (ECT)) o Teaching Fellow (job description and person specification ) o Course Tutor ( job description ) o Assistant Professorial Lecturer ( job description ) o Associate Professorial Lecturer ( job description ) o Professorial Lecturer ( job de scription ) • LSE Fellow ( job description and person specification ) 2.3 Each Department that intends to appoint to a NAC/NRSC/ECT appo intment is expected, at the start of each academic year, to have in place a statement of its recruitment process. Any new statement, as well as any significant changes to existing statements, require the approval by the VCAC and PDFD before they are publis hed for advert. 2.4 Detailed implementation of recruitment strategies are arranged and implemented at the Department’s discretion, subject to the common aim of all recruitment processes in the School and the policy aims and principles. This includes decisions as to (i) the exact timing of recruitment and advertisements and (ii) the modes of interaction between the Department and applicants that best meet the overall aim of recruitment under the Department's particular conditions. 2.5 All advertisements of grades 7 and higher require the authorisation by the VCAC or the PDFD who can decide that a recruitment campaign is initiated too late in the academic cycle, and should therefore be postponed to the next academic year to guarantee an adequate search. For roles b elow grade 7 such decisions can be made at Department level.  3. Advertising 3.1 The recruiting manager, or vacancy manager by way of delegated authority, should create the vacancy, using the School’s e-Recruitment system. The recruiting manager/vacancy manager should upload electronic copies of the advert, job description and person specification (in the appropriate templates) to the e -Recruitment system. Job adverts should state a departmental contact email address as a contact point for applicants. Should the recruiting manager wish to make changes to the standard ‘how to apply’ document, this should be sent to your HR Adviser following the same format as the standard template ( no supporting documents and three supporting documents ). Creating the vacancy on the e - Recruitment system will trigger a notification to the Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) Manager who will be required to approve or reject the request to recruit based on the funds available. Should the post be approved, an automatic email will then be sent to the HR Adviser who will be required to approve the vacanc y before it is published by the HR Operations team. An HR Adviser will check the documentation and may suggest amendments in order to comply with legislation (to include visa sponsorship requirements) and School considerations. Recruiting managers will be responsible for making any required changes to their documents before publication. 3.2 The VCAC or PDFD must also approve all recruiting documentation, prior to the vacancy being published, for the below roles. No advertisements should therefore be placed in the press or on the School website until they have first been approved by the VCAC or PDFD, who will also satisfy themselves, that the proposed advertising campaign will fully support an open, active and global search. o The VCAC is responsible for approving the following roles: Assistant Professors, Assistant Professorial Research Fellows, Assistant Professorial Lecturers, Research Fellows and Policy Fellows. o The PDFD is responsible for approving the following roles: Associate Professors, Associate Professor ial Research Fellows, Associate Professorial Lecturers, Professors, Professorial Research Fellows, Professorial Lecturers, Senior Policy Fellow and Distinguished Policy Fellow. 3.3 The recruiting manager/vacancy manager should indicate an initial recruitm ent schedule via the e -Recruitment system. Please note that the interview date/s are indicative only and VCAC/PDFD approval of the role being published does not also approve the proposed interview date – you should liaise with your HR Administrator regarding this. 3.4 Guidance on how to use the e -Recruitment system, along with a series of process maps outlining the steps involved in a recruitment journey is available. 3.5 Staff eligible for redeployment will be given priority access to vacancies before they are advertised more widely to the School or externally. Recruiting managers should consult the Redeployment Policy and Procedure or their HR Adviser for further guidance.  3.6 All vacancies should be advertised on the LSE jobs webpage. Band 5 roles should be advertised for a minimum of one week to internal applicants. All Band 6 and 7, NAC, NRSC and ECT roles should be advertised externally for a minimum of two weeks. It should be noted that advertisement of Salary Band 6 and above are normally suitable for visa sponsorship. All externally advertised vacancies are placed on www.jobs.ac.uk and Times Higher Education, which are accessed by those interested in working within the Higher Education sector. Further guidance on placement of advertisements can be discussed with your HR Adviser. The cost of advertising should be appropriate to the level of the post. 3.7 Recruiting managers should note that if the successful candidate is likely to require visa sponsorship, in order to apply for a work visa in the UK, the post must be advertised externally for a minimum of two weeks and meet the minimum salary threshold. In addition, the visa should be applied for within 6 months of the date the post was first advertised within 12 months for PhD level posts, Recruiting managers should seek guidance as to whether the role that they are recruiting to is eligible for visa sponsorship from their HR Adviser before making an offer to someone who needs a visa. Recruiting managers should explore the Global Talent visa route for roles at Assista nt Professor and above, in cases where a candidate has a PhD. 3.8 For all NAC and research appointments, in addition to a CV and cover letter, applicants should submit up to three examples of their best published or unpublished work electronically, using the e -Recruitment system, at the time they submit their applications. Departments may invite candidates to submit references at the application stage or at a later stage (refer to section 6). 3.9 Departments that wish to advertise one or more posts across differe nt bands must follow the procedure outlined in the Advertising One Post Across Different Bands document which will help to mitigate the risk of discrimination claims from applicants who argue that the decision was made on the basis of their personal characteristics, rather than the requirements of the post. Departments are advised to consult with the Human Resource s Division at the advertising stage for a discussion about the case before proceeding. The VCAC or PDFD will take the final decision. 3.10 Vacancies will be removed automatically from the e -Recruitment system at 1 1:59pm (UK time) on the published closing date of the post. Any applications received after this time will be deemed as ‘late’ and will not be passed to the Selection Committee for consideration, except in very exceptional cases, following consultation wit h HR. This is to ensure fairness and that transparency of procedures is applied to all applicants. The decision as to whether to exceptionally accept a late application will be with the Chair of the Selection Committee, with advice from the HR Adviser. 4. Recruitment and Selection Committee (or Panel1) 1 Selection Committees and Selection Panels are the same  Composition 4.1 All Selection Committees should have a mixed gender profile and panels should include at least one man and one woman (though Departments are encouraged to seek gender balance or at least meet the School’s 30% gender target for Committees). Early consideration of panel composition by the Department is encouraged, and the Human Resources Division can assist in finding a diverse mix of panel members where this is not easily achievable for the recr uiting manager. 4.2 All panel members should ideally be at least one band higher than the post they are interviewing for. However, if there isn’t specialist expertise at the higher bands, it could be appropriate for a panel member to be the same band as the p ost being recruited to (if they have relevant specialist expertise) or, exceptionally, even at a lower band. Depending on circumstances, this should be approved by the panel chair or the VCAC; please consult with your HR Adviser prior to involving the pane l member in the Recruitment process. 4.3 Non-School staff (unless specified in 4.4), casual and agency staff should not be members of the Selection Committee. The recruiting manager should write to the VCAC or PDFD (as appropriate) for them to consider any ex ceptions. 4.4 Selection Committees should comprise of the following individuals. Role definitions are described below: Band 5 - Research Assistants - Teaching Fellows - Two or three departmental members, one of whom should be the line manager for the post. - One of the departmental members should be the Chair of the panel. Band 6 - Research Officers - Policy Officers - LSE Fellows - Three departmental members (one of whom should be the line manager for the post). OR - Two departmental members (one of whom should be the line manager for the post) and a Relate. - One of the departmental members should be the Chair of the panel. Band 7 - Research Fellows - Policy Fellows - Course Tutors - Two departmental members (one of whom should be the line manager for the post) and a Relate. - The VCAC, or a nominee of the VCAC, should Chair the panel.  5. Setting up the Selection Committee 5.1 Recruiting managers are responsible for securing departmental members, the Relate and External Experts (if appropriate). Recruiting managers should aim to secure panel members prior to the post being advertised. 5.2 For Bands 5, 6 and 7 roles, Departments should use ‘System A’ (as described below). For Bands 8, 9 and 10 - Senior Policy Fellows - Distinguished Policy Fellows - Senior Lecturer of Practice - Professor of Practice - Two departmental members (one of whom should be the line manager for the post) and a Relate. - The PDFD, or a nominee of the PDFD, should Chair the panel. SBA1 - Assistant Professors - Assistant Professorial Research Fellows - Assistant Professorial Lecturers - Two departmental members (one of whom should be the Head of Department) and a Relate. The Department may nominate a second Relate. - The VCAC should Chair the panel. SBA2 - Associate Professors - Associate Professorial Research Fellows - Associate Professorial Lecturers - Two departmental members (one of whom should be the Head of Department) and a Relate. The Departme nt may nominate a second Relate. - The PDFD should Chair the panel. SBA3 - Professors - Professorial Research Fellows - Professorial Lecturers - Two departmental members (one of whom should be the Head of Department), a Relate and two External Experts. The Department may nominate a second Relate. - The PDFD should Chair the panel (although the Director of the School reserves the right to Chair the Selection Committee). - Departmental member: an employee from wi thin the recruiting Department, with appropriate specialist knowledge. - Relate: a member of staff from a related Department with appropriate specialist knowledge as appointed by the Department and approved by the VCAC/PDFD. - External Expert: an external individual who is an expert in the discipline concerned.  NAC/ NRSC/ECT roles, either ‘System A’ or System B’ can be used for their recruitment activity: • System A - ‘Interview Selection Committee’ - Selection Committee to interview all shortlisted candidates, typically on the same day. • System B - ‘Paper Selection Committee’ - Shortlisted candidates visit the Department individually. The Committee selects candidates based on written documentation and feedback from Departmental visits of candidates and may “informally” interview shortliste d candidates. For NAC/NRSC/ECT appointments: departmental recommendations on longlisting and shortlisting can be made either by a Departmental search committee or by the whole Department (the Relate member must be involved in the shortlisting decision and can be involved in the longlisting decision). Where Departments employ a search committee to help them in the recruitment process, it should be comprised of at least 3 members from the Department and include (i) at least one man and one woman (ii) where e xistent, the departmental equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) advisor or a representative of the departmental EDI committee (iii) a reasonable balance between full Professors and other faculty, and (iv) in Departments with research clusters or grouping s at least one member of a research cluster or grouping other than the one to which appointment is being made. All academic staff who have a long -term stake in the appointment decision (including at Assistant Professor level) should have the opportunity to see applicants’ documentation (with the exception of reference letters) and provide input to decisions on preliminary selection (longlisting and shortlisting). An overriding principle is that there should be a gender mix at all stages of the recruitment p rocess – there should be no longlisting or shortlisting conducted by a single gender group. Departmental recommendations to the School Selection Committee should be formed based on a meeting of staff who are eligible to attend, speak and vote (or altern atively lodge their view electronically in case they cannot be present at the meeting). Departments have the right to restrict the eligibility of staff to Professors or to Professors and Associate Professors. 6. References 6.1 Reference letters, for all levels of appointment, should be solicited by recruiting managers, or their delegated vacancy manager, using the e -Recruitment system (guidance is available). References can be required at any point – at the point of submitting applications, at the point of longlisting candidates (for references to be ready for the shortlisting stage) or at the shortlisting stage. If references have not been solicited before shortlisting, they must be solicited after the shortlist has been confirmed, so that they can all be considered at the Selection Committee meeting. References can be taken up by telephone or video -call but must be followed up with a reference letter. 6.2 References are provided on a confidential basis. Any request for disclosure of references  must be forwarded to the LSE Data Protection Officer. References should only be used for the purposes of which they were intended and their confidentiality must be maintained. References are availabl e to members of the Selection Committee and can be made available to members of a Departmental search committee (where existent), but for confidentiality reasons cannot be made available to all members of academic, research or teaching staff. References ca n be made available to all Professors in a Department, however. 7. Confidentiality, 7.1 All applications received in connection with a vacancy, should be treated with confidentiality and in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (2018)). CVs of candidates can and normally should be circulated to all members of departmental NAC/NRSC/ECT staff (depending on the post in question) on the understanding that these be treated confidentially and not passed to others. All staff involved in recruitment and selection should ensure that confidentiality is paramount. 8. Conflicts of Interest in Recruitment 8.1 The Schools Conflict of Interest Policy states that a conflict of interest arises where there is an actual or potential risk or a perceived conflict in duties between acting in the best interests of the School and formal and/or informal commitments, obligations or undertakings to another body/association/ affiliation in relation to the same or related matters. A Conflict of loyalty is where overlapping personal interests or loyalties could, or be perceived to, prevent an individual from making a decision only in the best interests of the School; 8.2 In recruit ment, a conflict of interest arises primarily when a person involved in the recruitment process (i.e. a selection committee member): • Has, or has had, a close personal or working relationship with an applicant; • Is related to an applicant; • Has prior knowledge of an applicant outside of the work environment which could potentially affect the decision they make. 8.3 Conflicts of interest could include, but are not limited to, when a member a selection committee /panel : • Is involved in the shortlisting and/or interviewing of a candidate who is a spouse, partner, close friend or other family member; • Is currently or has been an academic supervisor or a co-supervisor of a candidate who has applied for a job; • Is a co-author on a publication with a candidate who has applied for a job; • Has a close working relationship with a candidate who has applied for a job, such as previous line management responsibility or previous relationships as a client and/or consultant. 8.4 Identifying and declaring a conflict of interest : i. All selection committee or panel members must have completed a declaration of interests. Human Resources will review the declarations of all committee members and alert the Chair of the committee to any potential conflicts. ii. All selection committee or panel members must review the list of all applicants for a  post to identify any potential, actual or perceived conflicts (see examples above). Any identified conflicts must be declared to the designated HR adviser as soon they are identified. This is essential to ensure that any potential conflicts can be avoided or managed as early as possible in the process. iii. All those involved in recruitment are responsible for notifying HR when they become aware of any conflict at any stage of the recruitment process. iv. Given the wide participation in academic recruitment processes for NAC, NRSC and ECT roles, conflicts of interest may also exist for colleagues who are neither formally serving on search committees or on the School’s selection panel. Such conflicts of interest should be declared to the Head of Department or Centre/Institute Director, so will inform HR so that they can be taken into account during the recruitment process. v. The designated HR Adviser will provide the details of any declared conflict to the Vice Chair of the Appointments Committee (VCAC) or Pro-Director (Faculty Development) (PDFD) for academic, research and teaching posts,. 8.5 Assessing and Managing Conflicts of Interest i. HR will advise the VCAC/PDFD on assessing the significance and implications of the declared conflict of interest. The VCAC/PDFD/Chair will decide on whether a conflict of interests exists and the appropriate management of the conflict which may include withdrawal from all or part of the process. ii. If the Chair has a conflict, this must be declared to HR who will consult with the PDFD or the School Secretary to assess and agree on the management of the conflict. iii. It is important to note that considering conflicts of interest involves a spectrum of directness and significance. Several factors may need to be considered when assessing the seriousness of the conflict of interest and potential for bias. Due to the complexity of reviewing both the conflicts of interest and the specialist requirements on the selection panel there can be a variety of outcomes for the management of different types of conflicts. The management will vary according to the job role of individual panel members. iv. HR will record on file any declaration s of interests, the consideration and the decision on the appropriate management of the conflict of interest. This will also be noted in the interview records. 9. Compliance 9.1 All recruitment and selection should be conducted in compliance with current employment legislation. 10. Longlisting and Shortlisting 10.1 A longlist of candidates is drawn up first. This would normally comprise all candidates that appear to fulfil all the essential requirements ; should this result in a large long -list the  list can be further pruned to candidate s that best meet the essential criteria. The longlist can be established based on the candidat es’ application letters and CVs only. Where the longlist is drawn up by a Departmental search committee it should be shared with all members. 10.2 Key points to note when shortlisting: • The shortlist is also constructed on the basis of the candidates’ application letters and CVs, but will crucially involve a reading of the candidates’ submitted supporting documents (if applicable) by members of Departmental search committee (where existent) and the Departmental representatives on the Selection Panel. It follows that candidates who were deemed to fulfil all the essential requirements for the post at the longlisting stage may be deemed to no longer fulfil all the essential requirements with the updated information set at the shortlisting stage; • Only candidates who meet all the essential criteria should be shortlisted for interview; • All applicants, whether internal or external, should be treated objectively and fairly ; • If a high number of applicants meet all the essential criteria, use the desirable criteria and/or who fulfils the essential criteria better to reduce the number of shortlisted applicants further. However, it should be noted that any candidate who has opted into the Disability Confident Scheme and meets all essential criteria should be invited to interview (see 8.4); • Panel members should complete their shortlist electronically, assessing applicants against the role’s published person specification. Do not change the criteria, or create new ones, as this could be interpreted as discrimination; • Provide clea r, justifiable reasons for both shortlisting and not shortlisting all the applicants in the ‘comments’ column on the electronic shortlisting grid. Where applicable, comments should be provided on both the research and teaching requirements of the role as w ell as consideration of applicants’ supporting documentation; • Applicants can request access to the shortlisting notes. Do not write anything that could be misinterpreted or lead to a challenge of discrimination; 10.3 It is normal practice at the Scho ol for panels to shortlist up to five candidate s for one post and up to eight candidates for two posts. Departments can bring in a smaller (or larger) number of candidates where they have first discussed the matter with the Chair of the Selection Committee. 10.4 The School is part of the Disability Confident Scheme, which includes the following actions to ensure that the School’s recruitment processes are as inclusive and accessible as possible: • Applicants who indicate that they have a disability will be offered an interview provided that they meet the essential criteria for a role • Reasonable adjustments will be offered and provide d to any interview candidate with a disability 10.5 For NAC appointments, some Departments may, in accordance with common practice in their field, interview selected applicants at job market fairs taking place at international  conferences (considered as the lo nglist stage). In such cases, to speed up the process and given potential candidates receive simultaneous invites from competing universities, the Chair of the Selection Committee may decide to confirm that, after the job market interviews, the Department can proceed to invite shortlisted candidates for Departmental visits without further approval needed. 10.6 It is the responsibility of the Selection Committee members doing the shortlisting to ensure that shortlisted candidates meet the published criteria on t he person specification, though the Chair is also able to check a sample of the documentation to satisfy themselves. The Chair of the Selection Committee has the final decision in confirming the shortlist and in asking questions of the Selection Committe e to satisfy themselves as to the process followed to date. Interview invitations are only sent out to candidates once the Chair approv es the final shortlist. 10.7 If the shortlisting is completed manually, the shortlisting grid should be uploaded into the e-Recruitment system by the vacancy manager. For Salary Band 7 and NAC/NRSC/ECT roles, the recruiting manager should make their HR Adviser aware of when the completed shortlisting grid has been uploaded into the e -Recruitment system. The HR Adviser will then check the shortlisting grid and request that the Chair of the Selection Committee reviews and confirms a shortlist. In the event that no ap plicants are shortlisted, the recruiting manager must still ensure that the shortlisting grid is completed and uploaded. The recruiting manager can contact their HR Adviser for advice on re -advertising or the best alternative course of action. 10.8 Recruiting managers should ensure that the shortlisting is completed in a timely fashion, remembering that applicants should normally be pro vided with at least 5 working days’ notice of an invitation to interview. Recruiting managers, or delegated vacancy managers, should send interview invitations, using the appropriate templates, to shortlisted candidates using the e-Recruitment system. Departments are responsible for arranging presentations, informal interviews and interviews and liaising with the candidates about the details of these. The Human Resources Division will support with booking interview rooms and ordering catering for NAC/NRSC/ECT appointments. 10.9 Recruiting managers, or delegated vacancy managers, are responsible for updating candidates’ statuses on the e-Recruitment system. The system will send regret notifications to unsuccessful applicants and candidates automatically, when their application status is changed to either ‘regret after shortlisting’ by the Chair or recruiting manager. Updating a candidate’s status on the e -Recruitment s ystem is essential to ensure that monitoring of data for each year’s Appointments Committee can be captured and accurately presented. 10.10 The School expects to give fair and equal consideration to applicants from overseas, however some candidates may experien ce practical difficulties in attending an interview. Where an overseas applicant is unable to visit the School for an interview in person, or where it is the preferred way for the Department to interview, these can be conducted online (for example Zoom ).  10.11 The School has regulations for interview expenses, which sets out the items a candidate can claim for their interview expenses. The Human Resources can only reimburse candidates for expenses as set out in the regulations for interview expenses and on submission of the original valid receipt(s). Separately, the School also offers a service which books travel on behalf of the candidate in order that the cost is absorbed by the School immediately, rather than via the expense claim process. 11. Presentations and Informal Meetings (if applicable) 11.1 Presentations and question/answer sessions should be long enough to give the candidate a fair opportunity to present their research, and respond to questions. An hour per candidate might be considered appropriate.. 11.2 Departments a re encouraged to consider further provisions in accordance with best practice in their field, for example a requirement to demonstrate sample teaching (whether in the form of a written lecture outline or the delivery of a sample lecture) or the offer of a meeting with the Department’s PhD students. Each candidate should be offered similar opportunities for informal meetings, at least with the Head of Department individually and with other Department members in small groups, including in all cases key staff involved in the expected teaching responsibilit ies connected to the post. Departments should be critically aware of and openly discuss potential unconscious biases developing during informal meetings with candidates. 11.3 For System A, informal meetings and research presentations should normally take place on the day prior to the Selection Committee or on the morning of the Selection Committee, so that the outcome can be taken into account by the Selection Committee at the end of the interviews ( this requirement can be modified where candidates are brought in one at a time). For System B, informal meetings and presentations can take place at any point between the confirmation of the shortlist and the meeting of the Selection Committee. 11.4 Presentati ons are primarily intended to provide relevant information for the Departmental panel members in relation on the candidates’ research and oral communication skills and therefore their ability to meet the person specification criteria, and it is their respo nsibility to relay any relevant information to the full Selection Committee when it meets. The ‘Relate’ is invited to, but not required to attend, the presentations. The Head of Department (or a suitable alternative) should co -ordinate the presentations e nsuring that candidates are assessed in a fair and equal manner. For example, there should be similar questioning of each candidate. 11.5 Where presentations are being carried out online they may be recorded with the consent of the candidate. Any recording s should only be used for the purpose of the panel assessing the best candidate(s) for appointment. Any recordings should be de leted within 6 months of the recording being made.  12. Selection Committee Meetings 12.1 Selection Committee meetings start with a pre-meeting, in which all Selection Committee members meet to agree the format of the proceedings and take care of formalities. 12.2 The Chair will lead the pre -meeting and will ask all panel members to confirm that they have read and understood the following: the School’s EDI Policy Statement, the Data Protection legislation do’s and don’ts, and the Declaring conflicts of interest during the recruitment process document. The Chair will also ask panel members to declare any potential conflicts of interests, such as close professional and/or personal relationships with any of the candidates, and revisit any previous declarations as per Section 7. This is to help the School comply with its legal obligations and to emphasise the importance that the School places on equality and diversity. Under Data Protection legislation, notes of the interview should be kept locally by the recruiting manager for a minimum of six months following the selection process, after which they can be destroyed confidentially. Should the successful candidate require visa sponsorship, the notes of the shortlisting and interview decisions should be sent through to hr.admin@lse.ac.uk. 12.3 The Chair will remind the Selection Committee of the selection criteria which were agreed for the job, against which shortlisting has been conducted and the applicant s will be measured, which the Selection Committee should bear in mind. 13. Interview Selection Committees 13.1 The Selection Committee will agree the broad pattern of questioning at the pre -meeting. While the School must ensure that all applicants have the same opportunity to demonstrate their suitability for the post and how they meet the Person Specification crit eria, the main purpose of any job interview is to fully understand the academic (including research) capabilities of the candidate.. 13.2 Interviewers can help candidates to perform well by making their questions brief and clear, and the Chair should ensure that discussions remain relevant. An interview is neither a presentation nor a seminar and the temptation for other members of the Selection Committee to share their own detailed views should be prevented by the Chair. Equally, the Chair should do their be st to facilitate robust intellectual exchanges during an interview. 13.3 By convention, interviews for non -Professorial level posts are typically 30 -45 minutes long, while Professorial level interviews are typically 50 minutes. Departments are able to alter th ese accordingly (for example, if a short presentation has been requested by the Department at the interview for a non -Professorial level post) but should do so in conjunction with communication with the Chair of the panel. Common sense suggests that  longer interviews can be accommodated where there are fewer shortlisted candidates. The allocation of time in interviews is the responsibility of the Chair who is also responsible for seeing that adequate time is left for the candidate’s answers and questions to the Selection Committee. 13.4 Departmental panel members (and the External Experts in cases of professorial level appointments) are expected to have acquainted themselves with the applicant’s written work before the interview. They carry the main responsibility for probing the applicant’s suitability for the job. The main role of the Relate is to ensure that, as far as possible, similar standards are applied throughout the School. They are not expected to ask technical questions (though they may do so if they wish) but should concentrate on matters such as the applicant’s commitment to academic life and breadth of interests in the social sciences. 14. Paper Selection Committees 14.1 With the candidates not being present for interviews, the Selection Committee members have the responsibility to comprehensively review the shortlisted applicants based on the CVs, application letters, references, writings and the information provided by the Departmental representatives on the candidates’ visit and presentations to the Depa rtment and the quality of their writings. 14.2 This process starts by the Chair asking the Departmental representatives to comment on the process followed (not the conclusions) of the recruitment process. The Chair then invites the Relate to ask questions on t he process. 14.3 Following this, the Chair asks the Departmental representatives to report in detail on the Departmental visits of each candidate in turn. The Departmental representatives comment also on the written work and on the candidates’ presentation at their Departmental visit. The Chair invites the Relate to ask questions. No decisions are made at this stage. 15. Making the Decision 15.1 After all shortlisted applicants have been interviewed (System A) or comprehensively considered (System B), the Selection Committee will discuss the candidates’ suitability for the post. In all cases, discussion of candidates will not be confined to perfor mance at interview, but should take proper and full account of the reading and grading of candidates’ work, their presentations and discussions with Departmental members (including PhD students, where they have been consulted following a presentation to th e Department). The HR Adviser will be present for the discussion should any advice be sought by the Selection Committee, and note the decision taken, and the criteria in the Person Specification on which the decision is based. 15.2 The Chair will lead the dis cussion, and ask the panel members to agree if there are any  candidates to whom an offer should not be made. The term ‘unappointable’ is used to describe a candidate who did not demonstrate the criteria of the Person Specification needed for the post and s hould, therefore, not be made an offer of appointment. The views of Committee members are requested by the Chair in the following order: External Experts, Relate, Departmental representatives. The Chair states their view last. If there are any candidates t hat were considered to be ‘unappointable’, this should be recorded, along with the reasons why the candidate was ‘unappointable’. Reasons must relate to the Person Specification. The Selection Committee should then consider if any appointment can be made. If in doubt the Selection Committee should not appoint. Instead, the Department should begin the search process again, possibly with a revised Person Specification. The Selection Committee should then rank the applicants who are considered potentially suitable. The views of Committee members are requested by the Chair in the following order: External Experts, Relate, Departmental representatives. The Chair states their view last. It is not essential to vote on an applicant’s appointment if there is an agree ment. If a vote is taken, the Chair may vote as a member of the Selection Committee and if there is a tie, the Chair has the casting vote. 15.3 For NAC/NRSC/ECT appointments: if in the event the top -placed applicant does not accept the offer, the VCAC/PDFD and the Head of Department should discuss first whether any further offers should be made and review whether appointment of such lower -placed applicants is consistent with the overall aim of recruitment. 15.4 The Chair should summarise the decisions of the Selection Committee in respect of each applicant. It is essential that the Selection Committee agrees reasons as to why applicants are or are not successful, as this will form the official record of the proceedings in the event of a challenge of the decision. The HR Adviser should be present and note the decisions taken. 16. Making Offers 16.1 Once the Selection Committee has decided who it would like to appoint, the Chair and Head of Department should agree the salary and other aspects of the offer, based on the indiv idual’s current salary, skills, experience, salary opportunities outside the School, salary relativities within Departments and the range in which the salary was advertised. For the setting of starting salaries, see the Remuneration Policy for Faculty (Academic Staff) document. 16.2 For Assistant Professor appointments, the VCAC must dec ide, in consultation with the Head of Department, on whether an appointment is made subject to Interim Review and obtaining the Post Graduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCertHE) Full Fellowship -level qualification, in which case its successful completion is a requirement to pass Interim Review. Where a candidate has an established record of teaching and research, the appointment may be made post -Interim Review, although it is important to bear in mind that this will shorten the candidate’s Major Revi ew ‘clock’. Where, in addition to an established  record of teaching, a candidate can provide verifiable evidence of teaching excellence, the condition to obtain the PGCertHE can be waived but only upon recommendation by the Eden Centre. This should only be done in exceptional circumstances. The normal requirement will be that Assistant Professors should be subject to an Interim Review in the fourth year of their appointment and a Major Review at a point not exceeding the eighth year of appointment, in accor dance with the School’s Review and Promotion Guidelines. 16.3 The Head of the Department (or a nominee) should contact the successful candidate(s) to make the offer. The content of the offer should be as agreed by the Chair of the Selection Committee or, as appropriate, by the VCAC or PDFD. 16.4 Once the Head of the Department has made the offer, the recruiting manager, or delegated vacancy manager, should complete a second fund check on the e-Recruitment system and complete the ‘Offer Checklist’. Guidance on how to complete this is available. Once the second fund check has been approved, the Human Resources Division will sen d the candidate an offer of employment using the e -Recruitment system. In accordance with the School’s Financial Regulations, a second fund check must be approved by the Finance/Research Division before an offer of employment is issued. For NAC/NRSC/ECT appointments, an HR Adviser will send the draft appointment letter to the Chair and Head of Department for approval before the letter is sent to the successful candidate. 16.5 Heads of Department, or delegated vacancy manager, should normally inform unsuccessful shortlisted candidates of the outcome of the selection process. Recruiting managers are responsible for updating candidates’ statuses on the e-Recruitment system. The system will send regret notifications to unsuccessful applicants and candidates automatically, when their application status is changed to ‘regret after interview’ by the Chair or recruiting manager. S hould the recruiting manager wish to communicate the regrets verbally, they, or the delegated vacancy manager, will be able to do so and update the e - Recruitment system without sending an automatic notification. Updating the candidate status is a vital par t of the recruitment process in order that the Human Resources Division are able to provide accurate data to the annual Appointments Committee. 16.6 Unsuccessful interview candidates may contact the recruiting manager or the Human Resources Division to reques t formal written feedback following their interview. The purpose of providing feedback is both to leave the candidate with a positive impression of the School and to assist the candidate in developing their skills for future interviews. In the cases where the feedback request is from an internal candidate, Heads of Departments or recruiting managers are encouraged to give feedback to the internal candidate face -to-face to help support the School’s objective to provide career development and support to inter nal staff. A post interview pro -forma and guidance is available. The Chair or recruiting manager should complete the pro -forma and return it to the Human Resources Division within five working days. The Chair (and if applicable with guidance from the Human Resources Division ) will then help to make any suggestions or guidance on the feedback and the Head of Department or the recruiting manager will communicate this feedback to the candidate. Recruiting managers should not send written feedback directly to the candidate - all feedback responses should be reviewed by the Human Resources Division before being sent  to the candidate. For the successful candidate, the Chair (and if applicable with guidance from the Human Resources Division) will give guidance on the appropriate salary offer. 17. Appointments 17.1 An appointment must always start on a working day between Monday and Friday. 17.2 All new starters (including those who return to the School after a break in service) are required to complete a right to work check as soon as poss ible after they accept their offer of appointment and no later than 9:30am on their first day of employment. Those who do not produce evidence of their right to work in the UK by 9:30am on their first day are not allowed to start work. This means that their start date will be postponed and their salary, continuous service and any such related benefits will start from the new start date. Salary cannot be back -dated. 17.3 The School’s Immigration Policy provides further clarification on the LSE’s obligations as an employer and employees responsibilities with the respect to demonstrating their right to work in the UK. 17.4 New starters will be able to collect their Staff Card and IT credentials from the Security Office on their first day of employment, provided they ha ve undertaken a satisfactory Right to Work Check on or before their first day of employment. 17.5 Once the successful candidate has accepted the offer of employment and a start date has been agreed it is the responsibility of the line manager to ensure that a comprehensive induction programme is put in place. 18. Right to Work and Visa Sponsorship 18.1 All offers of appointment are subject to right to work in the UK. If the successful candidate is a national of a non - UK country, they will need to demonstrate that they have permission to work in the UK prior to undertaking any work of any kind on behalf of the School. 18.2 The School will only act as a sponsor if the role meets the criteria for sponsorship and the Department/Institute/Centre and the employee confirm that they will abide by their visa obligations. 18.3 The School will normally sponsor academic, research, teaching or policy roles, providing the salary attached to the role meets the minimum salary threshold. 18.4 A role must meet the criteria for sponsorship before a decision can be made as to whether to sponsor. The role must: • The minimum skills leve l of RQF3 (equivalent to A -Level) or above and  The minimum salary threshold which is either £25,600 or the minimum salary as set for that particular occupation - whichever is higher 16.5 In order to sponsor the role, the vacancy must be advertised in accor dance with the Home Office’s rules.. To meet the rules, the following conditions must have been met: • There is evidence that the role has been advertised externally for a minimum of 2 weeks (your HR Adviser will be responsible for taking screenshots of the adverts whilst the role is live) • The advert must clearly state the salary range on offer, and any market or salary supplements, where applicable • The advert must include a brief description of the job duties and responsibilities of the post, • The advert must include the key criteria which will be used to shortlist for the post and these must be consistent with the wording used in the person specification. 18.5 In addition, the salary offered to the successful candidate must be in line with the salary stated on the advert. 18.6 Only the Human Resources Division is authorised to issue Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS). 18.7 In order to sponsor an individual, the Department/Institute/Centre must provide a full shortlisting grid and a summary of the interview outcome to the HR Division before a CoS can be issued. Such evidence must be submitted to the HR Division. 18.8 In addition to the CoS, the individual must apply for their visa through the UK Visas and Immigration service and provide personal e vidence of competence in English and ongoing maintenance. 18.9 The visa application process can take up to three months and staff cannot under any circumstances be employed until the visa is granted and a right to work check has been conducted. 19. Disclosure and Barring Service Checks 19.1 It is School policy to require applicants to disclose any convictions, cautions, reprimands or final warnings that are not ‘protected’ as defined by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (as amended in 2013) as part of their application. The amendments to the Exceptions Order 1975 (2013) provide that certain spent convictions and cautions are 'protected' and are not subject to disclosure to employers, and cannot be considered. Guidance and cr iteria on the filtering of these cautions and convictions can be found in the DBS guidance however certain types of posts, particularly those that involve working with children or adults in a vulnerable position or other positions of trust or sensitive areas, are exempt from these provisions, and in these case s all convictions, cautions, reprimands or final warning that will not be filtered in line with the current guidance must be declared.  19.2 The Disclosure and Barring Service makes decisions about who will be barred from working with children and vulnerable ad ults. If a manager believes that the appointee to a vacancy will be working in a 'regulated' position, the appointee will require an enhanced criminal records check before commencing employment. The Human Resources Division must be contacted prior to adver tising. Applicants must be made aware early in the recruitment process that a criminal records check is a condition of the post. 19.3 Once the successful applicant has indicated their acceptance of a post the recruiting manager should contact their HR Administrator so that they can commence the DBS process for the candidate. Until a satisfactory clearance is received by the School, the employees’ work will be supervised by their Line Manager. Any information revealed in a Disclosure that is relevant to the nature of the role, and is likely to lead to the withdrawal or amendment of a job offer, should be discussed with the applicant by the counter signatory before the offer is withdrawn or amended.

       "  'text': ' 1. Introduction The holiday entitlement for full -time members of staff is 25 days’ annual leave plus eight closure days ( five days closure for w inter break and three days closure for spring break) and eight public holidays per year. Details of closure days and public holidays are set out in the School Ca lendar. The holiday entitlement for part -time members of staff ( including annual leave, closure days and public holidays) is pro -rated in line with contracted hours. For part -time staff and staff with varying work patterns, holiday entitlement is calcula ted and taken in hours. The leave year is the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December). I f a winter break closure day falls in January, this is accounted for in the previous leave year for the purposes of pro -rating annual leave. Full details of the terms and conditions including holiday entitlements can be found here. Hourly paid staff receive the same holiday entitlement as salaried staff and may take this in the same way. This is paid to them at 18.64% of their hourly rate for each hour they work, ie, the equivalent to the holiday entitlement of all other staff. Hourly paid staff are expected to take the equivalent holid ay time off throughout the calendar year. The Annual Leave Guide can be found here and the guide on booking annual leave through MyView can be found here. 2. Aims The aim of this policy is to set out the principles by which both managers and employees should manage annual leave entitlements. This includes clear instructions on carry forward limits and the use of annual leave during notice periods. The policy also aims to promote fair, transparent and unrestrictive practices on using annual leave to promote the wellbeing of staff and teams, as well as helping to support managers in maintaining effective staffing levels throughout the year. 3. Scope This policy appl ies to all salaried staff on Professional Services Terms and Conditions, including Research Assistants. Operational Use of Annual Leave Policy for Professional Services Staff  2 4. Principles Taking annual leave • Staff should take annual leave at regular periods /intervals throughout the calendar year. This is important in ensuring that they have frequent breaks from work to support their health, wellbeing and work -life balance. • In most areas, holiday leave, including bank holidays and closure days, is managed and recorded in the HR MyView system. • For full - time staff working Monday to Friday, bank holidays an d closure periods are recorded in MyView and balances are automatically calculated. For part -time staff, or full - time staff with a varying work pattern, individuals are required to book bank holidays and closure periods to maintain correct balance calculations. • In keeping with the above, and due to the operational requirements of most roles, annual leave will normally be taken in periods of ten days or less. If there are specif ic special personal circumstances as to why an individua l requires a longer period of leave, line managers may agree to approve this on an exceptional basis. • To support employees, colleagues and teams, employees and managers should plan and co-ordinate annual leave requests within team s at regular intervals, discussing overall team annual leave requirements alongside team business requirements. This is to ensure that annual leave can be planned out fairly and effectively throughout the year. • Members of staff will be expected to provide suitable notice of leave requests as set out in the Annual Leave Pocket Guide. • Line managers will be expected to ensure that there are n o undue restrictions o n staff taking annual leave and should take any specific personal circumstances into account. Whilst there may be some occasions when taking specific periods of annual leave may be difficult operationally, these should be limited as much as feasibly possible through workload planning and setting appropriate cover arrangements. Members of staff should be aware that, on occasion, line managers may not be able to grant requested leave at a specific time due to the operational impact. • Members of staff may wish to take their accrued holiday entitlement during long er-term periods of sickne ss absence1. In this case, they are required to request this with sufficient notice to ensure that pay can be processed accurately. Following such leave, m ember s of staff must either return to work or continue to provide appropriate sickness absence certificates in lin e with the Sickness Absence Notification Procedures. Carry forward limits • As per the terms and conditions of employment, a maximum of five days ’ annual leave (pro-rata for part -time staff ) may automatically be carried forward into the following annual leave year. • In exceptional circumstances, if there is a case to carry forward more than five days ’ annual leave (pro -rata), but less than ten days ’ annual leave (pro -rata) into the following calendar year, a case must be approved by the relevant service leader/academic manager /Head of Department or Centre Director. • In exceptional circumstances, if there is a request to carry forward ten or more days ’ annual leave (pro-rata) into the following calendar year, a case must be approved by the Director of Human Resources. • For staff who have been unable to use their annual leave due to extended period (s) of sickness absence, they will be entitled to carry forward a maximum of twent y days of statu tory holiday (pro-rata for part -time staff) into the following leave year. Staff will be required to use the additional leave that they have carried forward within eighteen months from the date of carry forward i e, by the end of June the following year. 1 This may be beneficial if an employee has exhausted their sick pay or has dropped to half pay.  3 Leaving the School / Moving Post • Once a member of staff resigns from LSE, they should agree with their line manager how any remaining annual leave (based on accrued holiday entitlement up to the last day of employment) will be managed during their notice period. Where possible, the outstanding balance should be taken before the employee’s leaving date. Members of staff should check their remaining entitlements and bal ances by completing the leaver form and annual leave calculator. If individuals have any questions on their annual leave balance, they can email hr.myview@lse.ac.uk. • Where a member of staff is moving to a different area of LSE and has a significant holiday balance, they should inform their new line manager of their leave entitlement and, where possible, take accrued leave before moving post. Exceptional application to extend carry forward limits • Where a member of staff has returned from a n extended period o f maternity or shared parental leave, with a significant holiday leave balance, they can agree with their line manager a phased plan of up to a maximum of two additional years to bring accrued carry forward annual leave balances in line with the standard terms and conditions of employment. In exceptional circumstances, the HR Partner can agree to extend the phased plan by one additional calendar year. • If there are legitimate business and /or extenuating personal circumstances in which a member of staff has been unable to take their accrued holiday entitlement before the en d of the calendar year, a case can be made to the Director of Human Resources to approve the payment of outstanding leave. Monitoring of annual leave • To support management of annual leave in line with the aims of this policy, all areas will be provided with regular termly manag ement reports on the usage and balances of annual leave for staff within their area. Human Resources Division will support areas to resolve any queries.

       "  'text': ' RETURN TO WORK FROM FAMILY FRIENDLY LEAVE: GUIDANCE FOR MANAGERS Returning to work from a period of family friendly leave * can be daunting and employees can feel anxious and isolated trying to balance their role as a parent to a new child with work demands. As a manager, it can be easy to forget or perhaps not fully understand that employees need to be welcomed back and reintroduced into the team and possibly to new ways of working. This makes a big difference in creating a positive experience for the employee in feeling part of the team again and getting to grips with their shift back to their work duties and responsibilities. To ensure a smooth transition back in to the workplace and the team, it is important that the manager plan s appropriately to support this. This should involve discussions with the employee leading up to the return to work. Return to Work Plan It is recommended that a re -induction or return to work plan is organis ed for the employee to be welcomed back to work. You can start by looking at a plan that you would put together for a new member of the team and tailor it accordingly. It may be particularly helpful to consider the following, where applicable: \\uf0a7 A personal welcome back from the line manager \\uf0a7 Ensuring all IT access and re -set up is completed prior to the employee coming back to work \\uf0a7 The arrangements for the handove r of work from other colleagues \\uf0a7 Updates on key projects/activities \\uf0a7 Any relevant developments/c hanges not already communicated \\uf0a7 One-to-one meetings with key colleagues/stakeholders \\uf0a7 Flexible working applications \\uf0a7 Breastfeeding arrangements and r isk assessments (if applicable) \\uf0a7 Communications rega rding the staff member’s return prior to them coming back to work \\uf0a7 Training requirements, including the renewal of any compulsory training \\uf0a7 CDR objective setting  Phased Return A phased return has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to get back into the swing of working. There are several ways that this can be achieved such as: \\uf0a7 Agreement for the employee to use KIT/SPLIT days towards the end of their leave to come in and do some work. \\uf0a7 Accrued holidays can be used to temporarily allow for part-time working after your employee’s official return to work. This can be mean working for only part of the week or working shorter days across the week. It is best to discuss the options with your employee as everyone’s needs will be different. Flexible Working Your employee may wish to request an alternative workin g pattern for their return to work. Flexible working enables greater employee wellbeing, job satisfaction and retention and managers are encouraged to be open to the prospect of flexible arrangements. A flexible working request should be considered in line with the School’s Flexible W orking Policy. Useful Documents The Family Friendly Leave Checklist is a useful tool to help you keep on top of the things that you need to d o to prepare for the employee’s return to work. NCT’s Pregnancy, maternity and returning to work: An employer’s guide is a comprehensive guid e with great advice for all managers that can be applied accordingly for all types of family friendly leave. *** It is also important to remember that your employee has a new child and will probably be very tired during the first few weeks and perhaps a bi t overwhelmed. Regular catch ups and one - to-ones with your employee will help to ensure that the lines of communication are open and that you best understand how to support them. *Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave or Shared Parental Leave '},\n",

       "  'text': '1 Purpose of policy The purpose of the policy is to clarify the obligations of employees and the LSE as an employer with the respect to the right to work in the UK. Background As an employer, LSE has a duty to prevent illegal working. The LSE has a statutory duty to ensure that all employees can demonstrate that they have the right to work in the UK before they start their employment and for the duration of their contracts. It is illegal to employ someone aged 16 or over who is subject to immigration control if they are not allowed to undertake the work in question. In addition, it is a criminal offence for an individual to work illegally in the UK. Conducting a right to work check ensures that LSE has a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty. This means that if the UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) find that the School has employed someone who does not have the right to work, but it has correctly conducted document checks as required, the School will not receive a civil penalty for employing that illegal worker. If LSE fails to carry out these checks correctly, or at all, and are found employing someone illegally, the UKVI will take tou gh action. LSE could face a large financial penalty known as a civil penalty of up to £20,000 for each illegal worker, or if it knowingly employs an illegal worker it carries up to 2 years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine for the individual who has t he authority to appoint. In addition, the sponsorship licence for staff could be revoked. This means that LSE will no longer be able to sponsor any new staff and all existing sponsored staff would be unable to continue to work with immediate effect. LSE ’s sponsor licence for students would also be affected, which would affect the School’s ability to sponsor overseas students. EEA Nationals As the UK has now left the EU, the Freedom of Movement legislation which previously allowed Immigration Policy Operational 2 EEA nationals to live an d work freely in the UK has ended. This means that EEA nationals arriving in the UK on or after 1 January 2021 will need a visa to work. The exception to this is if an EEA national was already living in the UK by the time the transition period ended on 3 1 December 2020 and has applied under the EU Settlement Scheme. The EU Settlement Scheme was established to protect the rights of EEA nationals who were already living in the UK when the UK left the EU and so they are allowed to continue to work in the UK beyond 1 January 2021 without any further action. Frontier Workers A Frontier Worker is an EU national who is normally a resident overseas, and who commutes to the UK on a regular basis for work purposes. As they are not a resident of the UK, they are no t eligible to apply under the EU Settlement Scheme. However, the government has protected the rights of EU nationals who had been commuting to the UK for work prior to 31 December 2020, given that they were previously able to enjoy this right under the Fr eedom of Movement legislation. Frontier Workers who can demonstrate that they had a commuting arrangement in place for work prior to 31 December 2020 will need to apply for a Frontier Worker Per mit and they have until 30 June 2021 to do so. Employees wishing to start a new commuting arrangement after 1 January 2021 will need to ensure that their visa status allows them to commute to the UK before making any changes to their working pattern. The re may also be other implications to be aware of, such as tax, social security etc, and so individuals should also refer to their HR Partner for further information. What is a right to work check? In order for LSE to meet its statutory duty to prevent illegal working, all recruiting managers must ensure that their employees demonstrate that they have the right to work in the UK before they start their employment and for the duration of their contracts. The term ‘right to work’ describes individ uals who have the appropriate permission to live and work in the UK. UK nationals have the automatic right to work in the UK, whereas all other nationals (including EEA nationals from 1 January 2021) will need a visa to work in the UK. A right to work check is the process by which an employer checks that an individual has the right to undertake the work that is being offered to them before they start the work. The process requires an individual to present their documents, which are inspected in their presence to ensure that they are valid and their photograph is a true likeness. A copy of the documents is retained on the employee’s personal file as evidence that the check was conducted. The School reserves the right not to pay an individual for any work undertaken before a satisfactory right to work check is completed or in cases where the documents presented do not meet with current Home Office guidelines. When should a right to work check be conducted? 3 The UKVI rules state that a right to work check must be taken before you employ a person to ensure they are legally allowed to do the work in question for you. It is not enough to simply undertake the check on the first day of employment if the employment has already started. Therefore, as a minimum, the right to work check should be conducted before the individual conducts any work for the School. For example, this could be before their first day, or by 9:30am on the morning of their first day before they start work. It is the responsib ility of the employee to demonstrate that they have the right to work before they commence their employment at the School. It is the responsibility of the recruiting manager to ensure that the LSE right to work process is followed. It is the responsibilit y of the Heads of Department/Centre Directors/Service Leads to ensure the local processes are compliant with the School policy. If an employee is unable to produce original evidence of their right to work, they will not be able to start their employment. In these cases, the School will defer an employee’s start date until their right to work is confirmed. Any salary, continuous service and other such related benefits will start from the new start date. Salary will not be backdated. However, it is good p ractice for the interview chair to conduct an “informal” right to work check at the interview stage, by asking the individual to bring their proof of their right to work in the UK with them to the interview. However, even where this occurs, the new starte r must bring proof of their right to work on or before their first day of employment, and be brought to HR. Right to work checks must be completed by HR and in accordance with the LSE process in order to provide LSE with a statutory excuse against liabi lity for a civil penalty. What constitutes ‘work’? Work is any activity that is related to the individual’s employment at the School and includes anything that helps to facilitate the person joining the School or starting their role. Examples could includ e, but are not limited to, issuing a staff card or IT access, being introduced to the team and/or other colleagues, being given a tour of the office and/or campus, being given training and/or equipment or undertaking any relevant reading. This means that the right to work check must be carried out before any of these activities take place. Who needs a right to work check? All employees and potential employees require a right to work check before undertaking any employment at the LSE. The right to work che ck lasts for the duration of the individual’s employment at the School and so if they leave employment and then return at a later date (also known as a ‘break in service’), they will need a new right to work check for the new period of work. Temporary s taff or contractors engaged via a recruitment agency will also need right to work checks, however this is normally the responsibility of the agency and they should have done this before they send the individual to undertake the assignment. For example, if you wish to re -employ someone who has worked for you previously, they will need to have a new right to work check, every time you employ them. What documents can individuals use to show they have 4 the right to work? If an employee or new employee has a n ongoing right to work, they will be able to show one of the documents that are stated under ‘List A’ (See Annex 1 ). If an employee or new employee has a time -limited right to work, they will be able to show one of the documents that are stated under ‘List B’ (See Annex 2 ). An employee will need to demonstrate that they have the right to work for the duration of their contract. If they have a visa which is subject to an expiry date, the contract will run until the same date, and the individual will need to obtain an extension before their current visa expires, or switch to a new visa in order to continue their employment. At present, an EEA national can still demonstrate their right to work in the UK with their valid EEA passport, however this will change from 1 July 2021 in line with the recent changes to the immigration system. Therefore, this guidance will be amended accordingly. However, recruiting departments should check with their new employee if they are eligible to apply under the EU Settl ement Scheme. If they are not, or they are arriving in the UK after 1 January 2021, the EEA national will need a visa before they can be allowed to start work. What is the LSE process for conducting a right to work check? The LSE’s terms and conditions st ate that employment is offered subject to the right to work in the UK. The contract letter and enclosure documents clearly state that new starters are required to undertake a right to work check before they start work and no later than 9:30am on their fir st day. The contract also includes an FAQ document on right to work, as well as a copy of the list accepted documents for right to work. It is the responsibility of the recruiting manager to ensure that the right to work check is completed by 9:30am on th e first day of employment, and in any case before the individual starts any work. If a recruiting manager would like their new starter(s) to start work later on their first day, for example because of team availability or because they work a different shi ft pattern, please send an email to HR.Admin @lse.ac.uk with details of the situation and confirmation that the person had not started work before they did their right to work check. Right to work documents must be inspected in the presence of the holder and normally, documents should be originals. However, at the time of writing, the UKVI has allowed employers to undertake a virtual right to work check process using scanned copies of documents to remove the nee d for an individual to come to HR in person. This exception has been provided by the Home Office due to the COVID -19 pandemic and is expected to be reviewed and/or removed when the situation improves. Can my new starter arrive for their right to work che ck later than 9:30am on their first day? Some recruiting managers would like their new starters to arrive for work later on their first day so that they have come time in the morning to make arrangements for their arrival. If you have agreed locally that your new starter should come in later than 9:30am, please send an email to 5 HR.Admin@lse.ac.uk stating the person’s name, their new start time and confirmation that they will not be starting work until after the rig ht to work check has been taken. Similarly, if a person has arrived later than 9:30am for a different reason, such as different shift patterns, the recruiting manager should email HR.Admin@lse.ac.uk with details of the situation and confirming that the person had not started work before they came to HR for their right to work check. Offering contracts It is only the Head of Department/Institute/Centre or the Department/Institute/Ce ntre Manager (or equivalent) who is authorised to make offers of employment. This is so that the contract process can be managed via a central point and to reduce the risk of offers being made without the correct process and/or right to work checks being made. Sponsorship The School has a licence to sponsor individuals who require a visa to work in the UK under the Skilled Worker route, which replaces the Tier 2 visa category, with effect from 1 January 2021. The School will only act as a sponsor if the r ole meets the criteria for sponsorship and the department and the employee confirm that they will abide by their visa obligations. The School will normally sponsor academic and research roles, providing the salary for the role meets the minimum salary t hreshold. However, sponsorship for professional services roles will normally be considered on a case -by- case basis and, in accordance with the rules for sponsoring individuals under the Skilled Worker route. Therefore, departments will need to make a business case to the School if they wish to sponsor a role under the Skilled Worker visa route. Further information on visa sponsorship is available on the HR website. Supplementary employment under the Skilled Worker route The Home Off ice guidelines state that those sponsored under the Skilled Worker route are allowed, in limited circumstances, to undertake other supplementary employment as well as that which their Certificate of Sponsorship was assigned for. Supplementary employment must meet the following criteria: a) be in the same Occupational Code of Practice and at the same professional level as the work for which the individual’s Certificate of Sponsorship was assigned or b) be a job which is on the UK’s current ‘ Shortage occupation list’ c) be for no more than 20 hours a week d) be outside of the normal working hours for which the individual’s Certificate of Sponsorship was assigned. In or der for a Skilled Worker Visa holder or Tier 2 visa holder to undertake additional teaching under the supplementary employment clause of their visa, they must be able to demonstrate 6 that they are being sponsored in the Occupational Code of Practice for Hig her Education Teaching Professionals (2311). Therefore, individuals who are sponsored to undertake research and are sponsored under a Occupational Code of Practice for research work, such as: Natural and Social Science Professionals not elsewhere classi fied (2119) (normally used at LSE) or • 2111 Chemical Scientists, • 2112 Biological scientists and biochemists, • 2113 Physical scientists, • 2114 Social and humanities scientists, are not permitted to undertake additional or ad -hoc teaching under the supplementary employment clause of their visa. Student visa holders (formerly known as Tier 4 visas ) Student visa holders are only permitted to work a maximum of 20 hours per week during term - time. This includes paid and unpaid work. A week period is def ined as Monday to Sunday. PhD students, 1 -year Masters and 2 year Masters students who are in their 2nd year do not have a summer vacation and cannot work more than 20 hours per week during this period. PhD students who have submitted their thesis bu t need to extend their visa for their viva or corrections, are also restricted to 20 hours work per week during term -time. Therefore, as part of the right to work check process, LSE is required to obtain confirmation that the student is registered for stu dy at a UK university and confirmation of their term dates so that their working hours can be monitored appropriately. Acceptable proof of term dates is either: a) a screen print of their university website showing their term dates, or b) a letter from their university confirming their term dates. Any student wishing to work more than 20 hours per week will need to demonstrate that they are eligible to do so before undertaking the additional hours. Students will be asked to provide evidence that they are eit her on vacation, or that they have completed all course requirements. Acceptable evidence is either a screen shot of the student’s university website showing their term dates or a letter from their university confirming that the student is on vacation, or that the student has completed all course requirements. Students are responsible for ensuring that they do not breach their working hours. The School reserves the right to monitor the working hours that student visa holders claim for and will refuse to pay any student for hours that they work over and above the maximum that they are permitted. In addition, LSE is obliged to report any student who is found to be in breach of their visa obligations to the UKVI. Further information about employing students and departmental responsibilities for ensuring compliance can be found on the HR Immigration Compliance website. 7 Students should be directed to the International Student Visa Advice Team webpages for more information if they have any queries about their visas. Other visas Other visas may permit the hol der to work in the UK. It is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that they do not breach their visa obligations and that they renew their visa before it expires. Ensuring compliance It is the responsibility of the employee to demonstrate that t hey have the right to work throughout the duration of their contract and, where relevant, to take appropriate action to renew their visa before it expires. It is the responsibility of the Department/Institute/Centre/Division, via the Head of Department or equivalent to ensure that: 1. Employees are provided with contracts before they start work 2. Employees (including those who return after a break in service) are asked to present their right to work documents to HR before they undertake any work at the School 3. Student visa holders do not work more than 20 hours per week during term -time. Further information on departmental responsibilities for ensuring compliance can b e found on the HR Immigration Compliance website. Cases of non -compliance will be escalated to either the Pro -Director for Faculty and Resources or the Chief Operating Officer, where relevant. Employer Checking Service LSE reserves the right to check an individual’s right to work in the UK using the Home Office’s Employer Checking Service if there are any reasonable concerns around whether they have the right to work. Reimbursement of visa application fees The School will only reimburse the visa application fees as specified in the ‘Visa Reimbursement Guidance’. Loss of the right to work If a new employee cannot demonstrate the right to work before they start work, the offer of employment will be withdrawn and the individual will not be able to commence work. If an existing employee loses their right to work during their employment at the School, or cannot produce evidence that they have the right to work, he or she will be required to stop working immedia tely and his or her employment will be at risk of termination. 8 Further information Further information on visa sponsorship is available on the HR website. Further information on student visas is available on Student website.

       "  'text': \"1 Etiquette Policy for Email and other Online Communication Tools 1. Introduction 1.1. The School operates in a fast paced and, at times, highly pressured environment, in which technology and email are used as essential methods of communication on a daily basis. With many staff working remotely and accessing technology across multiple personal and work devices, the good practice use of email and other online communication tools should enhance, rather than hinder, working practices and relationships with others, improving the quality of the working environment and culture in the School. When managed well, these tools also play an important role in enabling staff to achieve a positive work -life balance. 1.2. The etiquette expectations set out in this policy in respect of email and other online collaborative tools apply both to formal written communications and less formal messages (e.g. chat function in Teams). The wide applicability of the principles set out here, across different online tools and platforms, is especially important in the context of the School’s move to more blended ways of working where many staff will combine on-campus and remote working on a long-term basis. 1.3. This policy is accompanied by, and should be read alongside, Appendix A which provides further good practice guidance for staff. The content here should be read in conjunction with other School guidance concerning online communications, such as guidance from Data and Technology Services (DTS) on the use of collaborative working tools. Microsoft Teams (hereafter Teams) is the officially approved online collaboration tool for the School community; Zoom is an appropriate alternative for certain online events, e.g. online teaching seminars or meetings where a large number of people are taking part. 2. Policy aims 2.1. This policy covers all staff at the School and sets out what is considered acceptable behaviour in relation to the use of email and online communication tools (such as Teams). This includes internal contacts, i.e. colleagues, team members, students or volunteers, and those external to the School, such as contractors or service providers. Expectations set out here complement the Etiquette Policy for Email and other Online Communication Tools Operational 2 School’s Ethics Code and Dignity at Work Statement which apply to all aspects of work undertaken by staff. 2.2. This policy focuses on behaviours and etiquette and does not attempt to outline the technical requirements of the technology in question. Details about the School’s legislative obligations on how emails are handled in relation to being viewed as ‘data’ or ‘information’ can be found in the Data Technology Services (DTS) Division’s Electronic Messaging Policy. 3. Policy responsibilities 3.1. Employees are responsible for: 3.1.1. Adhering to the principles set out in this policy when using email and other online communication tools for work purposes. 3.1.2. Using appropriate channels to escalate any concerns, as set out here. 3.2. Managers are responsible for: 3.2.1. Ensuring that staff have access to the appropriate electronic tools that they require for their roles. 3.2.2. Responding appropriately where staff raise concerns related to the use of online communication tools or an online interaction while working for LSE. 4. Policy principles 4.1. The use of Outlook and other online communication platforms are highly beneficial for speed, minimal cost, convenience and collaboration when working remotely. Any written forms of communication (including emails and Teams chat) are covered by a number of laws in the UK and can therefore be used for legal purposes (e.g. an employment tribunal or court of law as evidence where it is deemed necessary). Individuals should also be mindful of the data protection implications of how they share and store such comm unications. 4.2. Although email is often regarded as informal, and whilst the Teams or Zoom ‘chat’ functions may be used to communicate in a less formal way, written correspondence in the workplace are still LSE communications and, therefore, all staff are responsible for ensuring that these interactions are professional and respectful at all times. Staff should also recognise that intensive or overuse of email can negatively impact recipients in several ways. 4.3. The excessive or inappropriate use of email, or emails containing unnecessary content, can result in ‘information overload’. This may lead to an individual feeling overwhelmed by the volume of emails received or by the extensive content that needs to be digested and responded to. This can negatively impact staff wellbeing and mental health, leading to outcomes that may include stress, anxiety, miscommunication, indecision or poor decision making, procrastination and other counter -productive avoidance behaviours. 4.4. Similarly, an over-reliance on, or inappropriate use of, Teams, or a similar online communication tool, can be counterproductive. Examples include: not allowing reasonable breaks in the day between online meetings; squeezing calls and/or meetings in without checking with the individual; calling individuals when they are already ‘in a meeting’ or ‘busy’; expecting staff to reply to emails and/or Teams chats when they are on a call; continuing to work/e-mail to the detriment of participation in virtual meetings. 3 5. Fostering good working relationships 5.1. When sending emails or Teams chats, senders should always be aware of their audience. In doing so it is important to keep any relevant dynamics in mind, e.g. where a senior member of staff emails a more junior colleague, what may seem to the sender as a request or suggestion may be interpreted as a directive by the recipient(s). 5.2. Equally, what one person may consider a reasonable tone may easily cause offence to another. Staff should ensure that care and attention is taken with email correspondence, just as it would be with a written letter, to reduce the potential for misinterpretation and misunderstanding. 5.3. Using the right form of communication at the right time can support effective and productive working relationships. However, sending the same message multiple times via different communication methods only serves to increase individuals’ workloads and potential frustration. Staff should take care to use the most appropriate method of communication in the circumstances and ensure that, for example, they are not tempted to immediately follow up an e- mail with a Teams chat. 5.4. The ‘cc’ option should be used only for its intended purpose – for information only, not for action. Care should be taken to not cc senior colleagues into an emai l in an attempt to show others up or passively escalate an issue. 5.5. The ‘bcc’ (blind copy) option should generally not be used in emails in the interest of disclosure and full transparency of communications to all parties. 5.6. When using Teams video conferencing (or a similar function), individuals should aim to replicate the usual office etiquette when contacting people – do not expect that somebody will always be ‘at their desk’, make sure that they are available to take a call and turn on your video camera whenever possible. 5.7. Whilst immediate responses should not be expected, individuals should aim to respond to all messages within a reasonable timescale and, where a full response is not possible, ensure that a courtesy response is provided. What is considered ‘reasonable’ will vary depending on the nature and urgency of the original message, and individuals should exercise their professional judgment when prioritising replies. Equally, if an expected response time is known, senders should be mindful of sending ‘chase up’ emails that may inadvertently cause additional pressure for the respondent. 5.8. Consideration should be exercised in the management of diaries and scheduling of meetings. In particular, staff should avoid placing appointments in other people’s diaries without due care and attention, causing stress, too many meetings and additional work for other individuals. 6. Wellbeing and online communications 6.1. In the same way as for work which is not screen-based, lunch times and other appropriate breaks are key to ensuring that staff have reasonable time to recharge and revitalise during the working day. Lunchtimes and other breaks also allow staff working online time away from screens and an opportunity to be more mobile. 6.2. The timing of breaks should be discussed and agreed locally. A break of 60 minutes for lunch is considered good practice, although this may vary depending on fluctuations in workload and length of shift. Staff should update their Teams status during any breaks to indicate whether or not they are contactable. 4 7. Out of hours communications 7.1. One way of fostering good working relationships is being conscious of email use and Teams communications out of hours. The normal School working day for full-time staff is 9.30am to 5.30pm and, for the purposes of this policy, “out of hours” communications are those before 9.00am and after 6.00pm. 7.2. Owing to the nature of some roles at the School, and the range of locations these may be undertaken, communications outside working hours will sometimes be both normal and necessary. For many other roles across the School, out of hours communications should be the exception rather than the rule. 7.3. Emails sent outside working hours can alleviate the sender’s workload, particularly as teaching loads and/or other intensive periods of meetings and commitments are predominantly set within working hours or can be convenient where travel is required. With technology allowing staff to access emails/take Teams calls via mobiles, tablet and laptops while on the move, the boundary between professional and personal arenas can also become increasingly blurred. 7.4. Whilst it is the prerogative of the sender to send an email whenever they choose, it is also the recipient’s prerogative to choose when to read their incoming emails (i.e. normally within working hours), provided this is in line with the accepted levels of professional behaviour and aligned with the expectations of their role responsibilities. There should be no general expectation that staff will read emails out of hours. It is also advised that, where an urgent response is needed during working hours, a follow up call may be more appropriate than a “chaser” email. 7.5. Senders should also be mindful of the impact on others when sending lots of emails out of hours, even if the sender does not expect a swift response. Arriving to work to a full “inbox” unexpectedly can be a stressor to recipients who may be deluged by emails both inside and outside working hours. 7.6. It is also important to remember that some departments within the School will have pre-agreed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) regarding response times to emails. It is expected that all SLAs should be reasonable, reviewed regularly by management within its own area, communicated clearly to all of its users and be respectfully accepted and adhered to by others. 8. Personal usage of collaborative tools and email 8.1. Teams and email functionality is provided to staff for work purposes; however, it is recognised that in a more flexible work -life environment, limited usage of work email for personal reasons is unlikely to cause a significant adverse impact on work produc tivity. Nonetheless, staff should ensure that personal use of collaborative tools and emails does not affect work performance or take precedence over work that requires urgent attention. Where possible, personal use should be limited to lunch breaks and other non-work times. 8.2. Staff should also be aware that any material containing inappropriate content is not acceptable at any time. Staff should also be made aware that, ‘deleting or ‘permanently deleting’ emails does not mean they are unrecoverable at a later date. Further details relating to privacy of personal emails can be found in the Electronic Messaging Policy. 5 9. Problem solving and escalation 9.1. Unless they have a serious and legitimate concern about the intent and/or content of an online communication or interaction, staff are encouraged to apply a degree of professional empathy. For example, staff could consider whether the matter is typical in their experience of the individual concerned, which may help to separate a ‘one-off’ from a more serious or persistent concern. 9.2. Where an employee reasonably feels that further action is merited, they may: 9.2.1. Speak with the person - ideally in person or by phone - reminding them about the principles within this policy and encouraging them to follow its advice. All staff should aim to support and remind each other of the importance of respecting boundaries and working in a professional and efficient manner. However, entering into email discussion about appropriateness of communications is rarely to be encouraged. 9.2.2. Where speaking with the person directly does not resolve the matter or is felt to be inappropriate (for example where the matter is more serious), speak with their line manager or their HR Partner in the first instance. 9.2.3. Escalate concerns about persistent behaviour which goes against the principles and spirit of this policy. Escalation should typically be through the line management chain and should be proportionate to the nature and seriousness of the matter concerned. 9.2.4. Where behaviour potentially falls within the remit of another School policy, raise a concern under that policy, i.e.: • Discrimination, bullying or harassment incidents (including those of a sexual nature) may be raised under the School’s Report It. Stop It. tool and addressed under the appropriate procedure. • Unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature should be addressed under the Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Policy. • The Dignity at Work Statement which clarifies conduct expectations as well as providing a means by which inappropriate behaviour which falls short of bullying or harassment be identified, addressed and resolved. • The Grievance Procedure provides staff with a formal mechanism for raising concerns, problems or complaints at work. 6 Appendix A: Good practice guidance for the use of email, online collaborative tools and online meetings This section provides good practice guidance that staff and managers should refer to so that online communications and interactions are inclusive and foster good working relationships. General • Consider which communication method is the most effective tool to use for the nature and urgency of the interaction you wish to have. The following principles should be taken into account: o Use email as a more formal means of communication, e.g. to relay information, make a request for advice or a decision or provide a summary of a discussion or meeting. o Email may not be the most effective tool where an urgent response is needed. In such cases, alternatives should be considered such as the Teams chat function, where a query is less likely to get ‘lost’ in a long list of emails. The chat function can also be useful for asking quick, simple questions that are not urgent and can be responded to easily. o As well as facilitating meetings, video -conferencing calls are an effective way of having a discussio n that might otherwise take place ‘across the desk’ or by telephone. • Whatever the means of communication, always act respectfully and treat others with dignity at all times, in line with the School’s Dignity at Work Statement. • Understanding how to use collaborative tools to enhance productivity and proactively protect the wellbeing of themselves and others is essential to its successful use and staff are encouraged to familiarise themselves by reviewing support and training offered by DTS and Microsoft generally. Written communications (Emails and Teams chat) • Write all messages in a professional and courteous manner. Whilst the written style may sometimes differ, the general content of a work communication should be consistent with other forms of written communication. • Keep all messages and emails short and to the point wherever possible. This will be beneficial for all dealing with large numbers of emails and assist with recipients working remotely on tablets or mobiles. At the same time, try to avoid being abrupt. Emails that are initiating a discussion (i.e. not part of an existing email chain) should typically include a salutation (e.g. ‘Dear…’, ‘Hi…’) and an email signature, except where the individuals involved are well-known to each other. • Re-read messages and emails before sending from the perspective of the recipient(s). Ensure your communication is clear, in particular, the positioning of instructions within the body of the message, highlighting clearly required actions. Where 'no action' is necessary and where the email is for only for information, this should be stated. • Do not leave the subject line blank in e-mails. It is also helpful, where possible, to make sure that the subject line relates to the content. • Ensure appropriate use of cc. and whether all participants of an email need to continue to be cc.ed or included in an email trail when the topic deviates to another issue. 7 • Be extremely cautious in the use of bcc. ensuring that decisions to do so would meet the standards of the Ethics Code, particularly with regard to integrity and transparency. • Consider minimising the use of graphics, different fonts, and formats stored within a document when sending it as an attachment to an email. • If sending a document internally, consider sending it as a link rather than an attachment – LSE tools allow online cloud storage, making it easier to share a link. Sending a link reduces electronically stored copies and therefore carbon consumption, as well as allowing for greater collaboration. • Be extremely careful when sending any communications or emails containing personal or confidential information or attachments. • Always check the recipient’s name, especially if there is more than one person with the same name or where a person uses more than one email address e.g. LSE work email and a personal email. • Before writing a message or email on a sensitive topic, consider talking confidentially in person or by phone instead. If there is a possibility that the email will be misconstrued, misunderstood or intercepted, it is probably best avoided. • Where the content of an extended email trail has changed direction or purpose be mindful of continuing to forward excessively long email trails to others or continuing to include others as either ‘to’ or ‘cc’ recipients unnecessarily. When forwarding emails or including new recipients, the sender should also be careful that there is nothing further down the email trail that should be kept confidential and/or not forwarded to others. • Avoid using uppercase text unless completely appropriate and necessary for particular emphasis (e.g. acronyms or initials of names), as this is often interpreted as electronic “shouting”. • Be careful when using humour or sarcasm within an email or Teams chat as this can be easily misinterpreted. Similarly, whilst using emojis or gifs can help to support the intended meaning of a particular message, the communication should still be professional and respectful. • If an email is sent outside normal School working hours and a reply is not expected before the next working day, it can be reassuring to recipients to explicitly state this in the email itself. • Automated ‘out of office’ notifications can be used to manage expectations for both the recipient and sender of emails (e.g. by explaining the time of return to work following a period of time off work, period of back -to-back meetings, exam times etc.). Where possible, it is helpful to ensure an appropriate signposted alternative is suggested. • An informative email signature is an impo rtant part of using email well. In particular, you should include an email signature if you are writing to someone for the first time, whether within the School or external. Your email signature should typically include your name, job title, and department, as well as your hours of work if you are working a non-standard pattern (e.g. part-time). Staff are also encouraged to include their preferred pronouns in their email signature, in support of a diverse and openly inclusive workplace. • When using or responding via a generic email address (e.g. a shared mailbox), the sender should include their own name to sign off emails. 8 • Once documents are finalised and unchanging (e.g. committee papers), do not use multiple attachments where possible. If such are necessary, it may be helpful to house all documents in a prescribed order, using a pdf format. Teams • Use, and respect, the flagging system in Teams (e.g. ‘available’, ‘busy’, ‘be right back’, ‘appear away’ and ‘appear offline’). These can help to manage colleagues’ expectations and ensure that you are able to protect break times or concentrated work time. Meetings and calls will be automatically reflected, and the status will change to ‘away’ following a five minute period of inactivity. Take care, however, to ensure that your status does not always suggest unavailability, particularly if you are a manager. • Check an individual’s status prior to calling them. If they are ‘in a meeting’, ‘busy’ or ‘away’, consider sending a Teams message in the ‘chat’ function to agree a convenient time to make contact and to mutually agree a video call via Teams. • Managers should not expect staff to be available whenever they call; at the same time, managers and staff can agree local arrangements for when they are available to speak, without the need for sending a message or email first. • The use of the ‘quiet hours’ function ality is useful to support wellbeing and protect work -home boundaries when using personal devices for work purposes. This can also help to protect time for uninterrupted, focused tasks. Meetings using video-conferencing • Turn the camera function on when interacting with colleagues on a video -conferencing call or participating in meetings. This helps to promote positive social interactions and build/maintain working relationships. If you are unable to use the camera function, e.g. due to internet connection, explain this at the start of the meeting/call so that people are aware. • Teams backgrounds can be used during video-conference calls. The appropriateness of the background image selected should be considered according to circumstances, e.g. formal meetings, committees and external appointments may require a more formal background than team meetings or social events. There are a number of preselected options on Teams; in addition, the Design Unit have created a number of LSE-specific backgrounds that staff are welcome to use. • Present yourself during a video-conferencing meeting as you would if you were attending a meeting in person. • Use the ‘mute’ button in meetings when you are not speaking, particularly in larger meetings or if you have background noise. Using headsets can also be an effective means of ensuring a better sound quality by blocking out external noise for those in the meeting. • The use of ‘private chat’ functionality is not encouraged during group meetings (i.e. separate conversations that do not involve everyone attending) and you should be mindful that such discussions can be misconstrued or shared, inadvertently or intentionally, with others. • Take care not to speak over people when in meetings. Use the ‘Raise your Hand’ function in meetings or include a message in the meeting chat to make it clear to the Chair that you wish to 9 make a point. • If you are chairing a new or irregular meeting, set out the required etiquette at the start so that everybody is aware of what is expected. • Video-conferencing meetings increases the screen time for participants and, therefore, the following principles should be followed to manage this as far as possible: o As a good practice approach, ensure a break of at least five minutes at the end of all meetings. If this is not possible, consider having a five-minute break halfway through. o Do not hold meetings between 1pm and 2pm to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to take a lunchbreak and have a break from the screen. o Keep meetings focused and on track, sharing an agenda in advance where appropriate. • Use relevant Teams functions to ensure that accessibility and inclusivity considerations are taken into account. Captioning functions and note-taking/recording functionality are available through Teams. It is courteous to ensure all colleagues consent to being recorded in advance of commencing, or before continuing meetings. All participants in a recorded meeting will be able to access the recording for a limited period of time following the meeting. 10 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start Three yearly November 2024 August 2024 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 November 2021 JNICC Contacts Position Name Email Notes HR Policy Adviser Kieran Darling k.darling1@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps the LSE has taken to identify, mitigate and prevent slavery or slavery -like practices, forced labour and human trafficking from taking place in our supply chains or in any part of LSE’s business. 1. Our Organisational Structure The LSE was founded in 1895 and is now one of the foremost social science universities in the world, ranked alongside Harvard, UC Berkeley and Stanford. As a specialist university, with an international intake, the LSE's reach extends from its central Lond on campus to around the world. The LSE is both a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Act 2006 and an exempt charity under Paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 of the Charities Act 2011. The registered office of the LSE is Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2 AE, United Kingdom. 2. Our commitment The LSE is committed towards taking steps to identify, prevent and mitigate the risks of modern slavery, human trafficking, forced and bonded labour and labour rights violations in its supply chains and global activiti es. We are committed to ensuring that our activities, collaborations, our contractors and sub - contractors and all those in our supply chains comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The LSE also adopts the principles of the Ethical Trading Initiative Bas e Code of labour practice and has created its own Supplier Code of Practice. The LSE also requires compliance with our Ethics Code. The Code contains a specific obligation to act with integrity and in accordance with all relevant legislation and statutory requirements. This includes compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The School’s mission of discovering, advancing and d isseminating knowledge to address major socio - economic challenges across the globe will always carry certain risks. Effective risk management increases the likelihood of the successful achievement of the School's strategic objectives, whilst at the same ti me protecting its reputation and sustainability. We are committed to buying ethically and to engage our community on sustainability issues as set out in section 3.4 of our LSE 2030 strategy (invest in a world class environment). The Modern Slavery working Group (‘the Group’) was set up in 2019 to review and enhance LSE’s response to Modern Slavery and to consider what it has or could put in place to address the potential Statement on Slavery and Human Trafficking for Financial Year 202 2/23 Governance 2 incidence of modern slavery and human trafficking within its business and within its s upply chains, areas of activity as well as in any international activities the School partakes in. 3. Reporting Concerns in the School The LSE takes all reports of labour rights abuses, modern slavery and human trafficking seriously. All members of the LS E community including but not limited to staff, students and members of council, are expected to report any concerns relating to modern slavery or human trafficking and encourage the disclosure of information about malpractice / wrongdoing occurring in the School. Members of our LSE community are signposted to : Seeking ethical advice and reporting concerns: https://info.lse.ac.uk/st aff/divisions/Secretarys -Division/Ethics/Seeking -ethical -advice -and-reporting - concerns Whistleblowing Policy: lsePubIntDisPro.pdf Any concerns raised relating to any suspected Modern Slavery in the School will be duly i nvestigated with action taken as necessary. 4. Procurement and Supplier Engagement The LSE Procurement Policy contains a specific requirement for all procurement to be undertaken in line with the LSE Ethics Code and Supplier Code of Practice. We make our expectations clear in our Information for Suppliers. We use a rigorous tender process for supply agreements, and our preference is to always use our own contract terms rather than a supplier’s bec ause this provides far greater contractual protection. This enables the LSE to ensure that suppliers are aware of the LSE’s position in relation to slavery and human trafficking and permits the LSE to terminate any agreement where it is confirmed that ther e is slavery or human trafficking involved. Specific Modern Slavery contractual clauses are being inserted into new contracts with a specific focus on those medium -high risk categories. We have undertaken spend analysis against our activities in 2022/202 3 and mapped our expenditure against the risk assessment for modern slavery provided by the Higher Education Procurement Academy (HEPA). A Modern Slavery dashboard with key indicators of performance for operations and supply has been developed as follow s: Category Spend Modern Slavery Risk Rating Professional & Bought -in Services including Consultancy £38m (2252 suppliers) Low Estates & Buildings £30m (111 suppliers) Medium Computer Supplies and Services £11m (191 suppliers) High Utilities £10m (6 suppliers) Low Travel and Transport £5m (134 suppliers) Low 3 Catering Supplies and Services £5m (132 suppliers) Medium Library & Publications £2m (124 suppliers) Low Health and Safety & Security £2m (50 suppliers) Low Audio Visual Supplies and Services £2m (49 supplier) High Facilities Operations £2m (31 suppliers) Medium Our Procurement team have continued to ask Suppliers to engage with the NETpositive Supplier Engagement Tool in order to help support our procurement response to Modern Slavery. The tool assists in engaging suppliers on the issue of Modern Slavery, raises awareness of Modern Slavery amongst our Suppliers, helps to identify actions our suppliers are taking in response to the Modern Slavery Act and provides a mechanism for support, guidance and training to the supply base to share best practice between suppliers. LSE has 11,831 registered suppliers on its Finance System, an order was placed with 7120 of them in the last financial year. There are 239 suppliers where we have spent more than £50,000 in a single year. We currently have 678 suppliers who have already completed our independent risk assessment system. The IT category is a high risk for the LSE and as such the c ontract was re -tendered and responsible procurement played a meaningful role in the decision making. The newly awarded supplier has completed the Net Positives tool. The AV category is our other high risk & spend area, the two largest suppliers of AV equi pment have completed the Net Positives tool.LSE also has access to Creditsafe & Constructionline which it considers as part of its overall due diligence during construction related tenders. As part of the tender for graduation services (gowns provision), the winner bidder’s locations in Cambridgeshire and London were visited by members of the Procurement team. The audit was positive, materials were locally sourced, the staff turnover was very low, flexible working was offered to Seamsters, apprenticeships were in place, the supplier had not been audited before by a procurement team and as a result of our intervention, they plan to deliver greater transparency of its inner workings through corporate videos explaining their processes and they plan to offer f actory tours to their other customers in the future. The LSE Supplier Code of Practice Following the creation of the Supplier Code of Practice (‘the Code’) codSupPra.pdf (lse.ac.uk), the Procurement Team have worked to ensure that it is embedded at the tendering stage for new contracts or during contract renewal for existing contracts. The Legal Team are also ensu ring that the Code is embedded within key contracts, The expectation is that all our Suppliers will comply /take steps to comply with this Code and mandate these standards from their own suppliers and sub -contractors. This would apply to all of our supplie rs of goods and services, consultants, sub -contractors, service providers, intermediaries and agents. In addition to Suppliers, the School also expects other organisations or institutions we collaborate with to also comply with the minimum standards set ou t in this Code. LSE reserves the right to monitor and review compliance, implementation and adherence with this Code via periodic reviews/audits as part of our contract management process. 4 5. Due Diligence We recognise that there is a level of risk in th e supply chains of goods and services we procure, although the risks we are exposed to are not unique to the LSE and are shared across the HE sector. We have worked to formulate Due Diligence processes that can be applied across the School where potential contractors, third part suppliers, collaborators and any other relevant third party are asked at an early stage about what policies and procedures they have in place to identify, prevent and mitigate against the risks of Modern Slavery. Due diligence ques tionnaires will contain specific questions about Modern Slavery. The Group have established which areas of the School and suppliers may be considered high risk and consider that further work will need to be carried out to further expand and formalise due diligence processes. Further consideration is also being made on when implementation of such processes will take place. A questions library has been created, including asking for evidence where appropriate and the key stakeholders across the School met to discuss due diligence processes and the needs within each specific area. 6. Recruitment The School ensures all legal right to work checks are undertaken and that there are robust visa advice/assistance provided. The LSE is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation which certified that all staff are paid a real living wage. LSE evaluates suppliers’ appro ach to fair working practices, including the living wage in line with statutory guidance and compliance with it’s Supplier Code of Practice. The School has taken steps to analyse the risks relating to staff recruitment and the use of recruitment agencies. Over the past year further work has been undertaken on centralising the use of reputable and established recruitment agencies via the Procurement team and the creation of a bespoke due diligence process that focuses on key issues including but not limite d Modern Slavery. Agencies will be asked to promote fair working practices. A standard contract for recruitment agencies which encapsulates the key terms and conditions the School would like to engage recruitment agencies on will be provided. Two main sup pliers have signed contracts, and a third has been planned. We will also soon have approximately 10 suppliers on our preferred supplier list, all of which will have contracts that will request compliance with the LSE Supplier Code of Practice. 7. Collaborat ions We actively engage with the London Universities Purchasing Consortium (‘LUPC’) and a member of the LUPC Executive Committee, framework supplier review groups, tender working parties and its Responsible Procurement Group that was setup to specifically address Modern Slavery Risks. This ensures that through this collaboration, maximum impact can be achieved with limited resources. Through LUPC we are affiliated to Electronics Watch which supports public sector organisations in monitoring the labour rights and safety of workers in global electronics supply chains. Our Procurement Director is also a member of the Board of Trustees, The Board of Trustees is responsible for fiduciary and programmatic guidance and oversight to ensure Electronics Watch achieves its mission and purpose and operates legally, ethically, and soundly. LSE contributed to the Electronics Watch Strategy Plan (2024 -2028) Review and has also been supporting endeavours to work with specific IT brands who were previously not engaging with Electronics Watch. The objective of the brand engagement is to improve the information and access for monitoring partners who collect evidence on the progress made in eradicating modern slavery abuses. 5 The Higher Education Procurement Academ y (HEPA) has re -started the Responsible Procurement Group (RPG) which members of the School attended. The RPG has set up several sub -groups to discuss the issues in more detail including but not limited to supply chain emissions, modern slavery circular economy & waste reduction, social responsibility, and supplier assurance (task and finish group). The Group also collaborated with other Universities and did a focus session on the Slavery -Free Campus blueprint for University Action against Modern Slaver y which was created by the Human Rights Lab at the University of Nottingham. 8. Training and Awareness Procurement staff receive training by passing the HEPA e -learning module on Modern Slavery to help identify the risks of modern slavery and improve proc urement practices. Any new members of the Procurement Team will also be required to complete this training in order to continue improving procurement practices in this area. Our Data & Technology Services (DTS) team received an awareness session modern sl avery in electronics supply chains. Staff within DTS have set up a working group to focus on our IT buying practices. Our Procurement team are all professionally qualified and maintain their certification by completing the Chartered Institute of Purchasin g and Supply Ethical Procurement and Supply course annually. Over the past year, the Group has initiated training via a specialist organisation for our Procurement team and members of the Estates Division as well as bespoke training for our Human Resources Division, Student Services and Counselling Services. Members of the Group also provided supplementary training based to the Human Resources Division to highlight key risks. Next Steps 1. Ongoing development to current risk assessments and use of the netpositive tool amongst suppliers The Procurement team will wr ite to a selection of suppliers on our larger spending contracts, where we would have a larger impact, to encourage them to provide details on the netpositive tool. Our use and analysis of the net positive tool will be ongoing to support our supply chain in creating their own action plans to mitigate the risk of Modern Slavery in the supply chain. In the coming year the Group would like to focus on the area of medium - high risk. 2. Further develop due diligence procedures and focus on medium/ high -risk areas/suppliers Our Procurement Strategy has been changed and now all category plans will have responsible and sustainable procurement contents as mandatory. Before each tender request, a procurement initiation document (PRID) will be completed and now includes elements of the LSE Supplier Code of Practice, this can be found here: codSupPra.pdf (lse.ac.uk) For the next year, tender questions to assess bidders capabilities against these practices and risks will be drafted and provided in a template format to be develope d 6 further by the tender evaluation panel prior to issuing the final tender document to bidders. These questions will be written in such a way that the responses will assess the current position of their individual journeys to produce a score that contribu tes to the overall tendering decision. These questions will also be enabled for the responses to be developed further; this would be encouraged and applied through the contract management process. Questions on due diligence relating to Modern Slavery are currently included in other due diligence questionnaires that are used in research collaborations / other types of collaborations. The Group will ensure that modern slavery questions are also considered and incorporated into any due diligence relating t o donations/fundraising. 3. Continue to ensure that specific Modern Slavery contractual clauses are included in contracts and specifically those contracts which may be considered high risk. The Legal and Procurement Teams to take a lead on this over the coming year. 4. Continually review relationships with all suppliers and assess any concerns of slavery or human trafficking on a case -by-case basis. Contract management guidance has been updated and now includes responsible procurement and supply chain risks for cons ideration and discussion, these now form part of the contract management process. Further training will be initiated this year with a focus on Construction which is considered a high -risk area. Resources will also be provided with further details, includ ing responsible procurement and supply chain risks. 5. Further progress work on recruitment agencies and ensure that relevant recruitment policies set out requirements to be aware of Modern Slavery. During the coming year we will also provide ‘an int roduction to LSE’ guide to provide temporary workers on campus information on what their rights and entitlements are in terms of what they should expect from LSE and their respective agency employer to ensure they are treated equally when compared to the d irectly employed LSE staff. The Huma Resources Division will work with the Procurement team to deliver this guidance along with a process map for staff to use. The Group will also be working with the Human Resources Division in order to add a section on M odern Slavery within the staff induction programme and consider what policies and procedures may need to be added. Further work will be carried out to ensure recruitment policies and other relevant policies/procedures within the Human Resources Division address key risks in relation to Modern Slavery. 7 6. Further consideration of reporting and escalation routes where an incident of Modern Slavery may occur and be disclosed/reported by a member of staff/student or a third party. 7. Work to ensure that Modern Slavery is considered within academic and research partnerships due diligence processes Continuous work had been done on due diligence for research contracts. Further work will be undertaken with major LSE research centres a nd the Research and Innovation Division to standardise modern slavery due diligence in our systems. During the coming year the Due Diligence policy and questionnaires will be reviewed and updated to ensure consistency of modern slavery risks across acade mic and research areas. 8. Continue to work with Electronics Watch and widen the awareness of their work and other modern slavery issues to all other Professional Services areas and academic departmental managers. LSE continues to work with Electronic s Watch and has an on -going presence on the Board of Trustees. LSE will be considering any future procurement activity with EW best practice methods. In the coming year, members of the Procurement team will be attending and contributing to three days of workshops for Public buyers and workers - advancing human rights together within the U.K. and other parts of Europe. 9. Develop appropriate training to new and existing members of staff in relation to Modern Slavery Training with a focus on medium to h igh risk contracts /suppliers such as in Construction will be initiated in the coming year. The Chair of the Group will also undertake training for safe contacts on Modern Slavery, spotting the signs of Modern Slavery and how to escalate incidents that may arise. Further liaison with specialist providers to run bespoke training will also be considered. Modern Slavery in the Supply Chain training followed by a workshop with key buyers in the School to be jointly delivered by the Procurement team and an external facilitator for Medium and High risk supply chains. The outputs of the workshop would help to inform future tendering strategies. 10. Raise further awareness on Modern Slavery and human trafficking via the creation of a webpage for the Modern Slavery Working Group outlining the aims of the Group and adding further information on Modern Slavery, resources, training, and the reporting of potential incidents of Modern Slavery. The Group will work on a central communication in the School’s staff news outlining the work carried out by the Group and raising awareness of the key issues relating to Moder n Slavery and Human Trafficking. This is an ongoing piece of work which will be developed in the coming year. 8 11. Develop and build networks and further engage and collaborate with other organisations and Universities and share good practice. To also c onsider joint initiatives with the LSE Students’ Union. LSE are a member of the London Universities Purchasing Consortium and Southern Universities Purchasing Consortium Responsible Procurement Group which enable members to attend events with expert exte rnal speakers, and member case studies with hands -on, practical experience advice to share. These members include universities, colleges and public sector organisations. The Group will continue to develop other networks during the year and will also look to work on joint initiatives with the Students’ Union. The Social responsibility sub -group (which includes modern slavery) will develop a tool kit of templates and questions for suppliers to complete which will include knowledge from LSE and the wider Higher Education sector. The Group will continue to collaborate with other Universities in this area as well as specialist organisations such as the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. 12. Supply Chain Investigation Program The LSE have run a graduation services procurement contract replacement project, and as a strategic requirement to the LSE and high risk in terms of modern slavery in the supply chain, we will be assessing bidders on their supply chains and the LSE will also develop manageme nt of those supply chains during the life of the resulting contract. The graduation services contract shall have ongoing management in terms of both its delivered services and inputs into the services via its supply chains. Further work will commence to see how a similar investigation could be carried out for other categories, including those not located in the UK.

       "  'text': '1 Disability Policy 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE (hereafter ‘the School’) is committed to providing and developing a positive, supportive and enabling environment for all staff, including staff with disabilities. This policy builds upon this commitment in the context of the Equality Act 2010, which places a general duty on all higher education institutions to promote inclusion and disability equality. Under these duties, the School is required to: • Promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. • Promote positive attitudes towards disabled people. • Involve disabled people in the formulation of actions. • Encourage participation by disabled people in public life. • Meet disabled people’s needs, including additional measures to enable them to work on an equal basis as non -disabled people. • Eliminate unlawful discrimination. • Eliminate harassment of disabled people. • Identify and analyse policies, practices and procedure s that are potentially discriminatory. • As part of its Public Sector Equality Duty, reflect in its policies and procedures that disabled people’s needs may be different from those of non- disabled people. 1.2. This policy sets out the responsibilities that apply to different individuals to ensure a supportive environment for disabled individuals. In addition to the responsibilities that sit with line managers and certain functions, the policy also details how the School’s Disability and Mental Health Adviser ro le provides confidential guidance to staff and managers as well as coordinating key areas to ensure that reasonable adjustments and other support are provided in a timely and appropriate manner. 1.3. This policy is accompanied by an Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) which aims to identify the policy’s impact in terms of protected characteristics as well as ways in which any negative impact may be mitigated. Further details on the School’s EIA process can be found on the EDI webpages. Disability Policy Operational 2 1.4. This policy is supported by guidance for staff and managers which clarifies the process within the School for agreeing, implementing and reviewing reasonable adjustments. In the instance of a conflict between this policy and the supporting guidance, the policy should take precedence. At all times, a fair and reasonable approach should be taken which focuses on solutions to support the employee in their role. 2. Policy aims This policy aims to: 2.1. Set out the ways in which the School is committed to creating a positive and inclusive environment for people with a disability or long -term condition, both seen and unseen. 2.2. Outline the process by which individuals can share a disability and be supported through a process of implementing and reviewing reasonable adjustments. 2.3. Provide a framework to contribute to the ongoing development of an enabling environment by addressing some of the specific practical needs of disabled individuals and providing support (e.g. training) for staff and managers. 3. Policy scope 3.1. This policy an d its supporting guidance apply to all School staff, whether salaried or hourly paid. Outside these staff groups, the School also has a duty of care – including a duty towards an inclusive environment as regards disability - to agency staff, contractors an d other individuals on School business. 3.2. A separate policy exists for the School’s student community. In addition to the provisions in this policy, staff who are also students can access confidential support and advice in relation to their student status via the Disability and Wellbeing Service, as part of the School’s commitment to an inclusive learning environment. 3.3. This policy should be read alongside other School policies that support a diverse, inclusive and respectful community, including: • The Dignity at Work Statement which applies to all School staff and clarifies expectations of behaviour, as well as setting out the means by which inappropriate behaviour which falls short of bullying or harassment can be easily identified, addressed and resolved. • The Ethics Code which sets out six core principles for behaviour that apply across the LSE community. • The Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Policy which sets out the process by which staff (and other members of the School community) may take formal action if they feel that they have been subject to discrimination, harassme nt or other adverse treatment on the basis of disability. • The Etiquette Policy for Email and other Online Communication Tools, which focuses on behaviours and etiquette when working and collaborating online. • The Capability Health Policy and Procedure, which sets out the procedure to be followed where a health condition is having a long -term and/or continuous impact on an employee’s performance and/or attendance. 3 • The Safeguarding P olicy, where an individual with a disability may also be considered within a vulnerable group. • The Fire Safety Policy, which sets out the arrangem ents for individuals with disabilities in the event of an evacuation. 4. Definition of disability 4.1. The Equality Act 2010 uses a definition of disability which includes but is not limited to those with physical or mobility impairments, visual impairments, hearing impairments, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (A D(H)D), certain medical conditions, mental health conditions, autistic spectrum conditions, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and other disabilities that may be ‘unseen’ (e.g. asthma, epilepsy, heart conditions, diabetes). The f ormal definition included in the Act is: “A physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long -term adverse effect on a person’s ability to carry out normal day to day activities” 4.2. The definition of ‘day to day activities’ includes mobility, manual dexterity, lifting, hearing, eyesight, speech, memory, and the ability to concentrate, learn or understand. The Act defines ‘substantial’ as being more than trivial and ‘long -term’ as bein g more than 12 months or likely to last 12 months. 4.3. An impairment which would substantially affect a person, but which is controlled by medical treatment or other support 1, is still covered by the definition of disability. This includes cancer, HIV/AIDS and Multiple Sclerosis effectively from the point of diagnosis. 4.4. Conditions that are expected to be temporary (such as broken limbs) will not normally be considered a disability in themselves unless indicated otherwise by medical advice and evidence. At th e same time, adjustments may be discussed and agreed locally, in consultation with relevant parties (e.g. HR) to ensure that the individual is supported in their role. 4.5. While acknowledging the medical definition of disability given above under the Equa lity Act 2010, in practical terms the School follows the social model of disability which focuses on addressing and removing barriers to participation among disabled individuals. 5. Policy responsibilities 5.1. In line with the Equality Act 2010, the School is committed to ensuring a supportive workplace environment for disabled individuals. As set out here, both line managers and certain functions within the School have important roles to play in ensuring that disabled staff are supported and enabled appropriately in their work. 5.2. Employees: 1 Equality Act 2010, Schedule 1, Part 1, Paragraph 5 4 • Are encouraged to tell their line manager if they have a disability or long -term condition that is affecting them at work, so that the School can ensure that appropriate reasonable adjustments and/or other means of support are put in place. • Are encouraged to share information about any ongoing or new disability -related issues that are impacting on their work s o that reasonable adjustments and other support can be implemented. • Have a role to play by treating everyone with dignity and respect, and in contri buting towards an open and inclusive culture within their teams in which individuals feel comfortable sharing information about a disability (if they choose to do so). 5.3. Line managers are responsible for: • Creating an open and inclusive culture that enable s staff to feel comfortable to share a disability and request reasonable adjustments. • Spotting the signs where it might reasonably be expected that an employee has a disability and/or might reasonably be expected that someone would need an adjustment. • Taki ng timely and appropriate steps to support employees who have shared information about a disability, including the implementation and review of reasonable adjustments. • When an employee shares that they have a disability, being open and receptive to the emp loyee’s needs, and seeking (and being open to) independent advice that can inform management of the condition in question, including reasonable adjustments. • Seeking further advice in a confidential and appropriate manner (e.g. from their HR Partner) before making decisions that impact on a disabled employee, as well as if they are unsure how best to support a disabled employee. • Attending relevant disability training to maintain up -to-date knowledge and awareness of disability issues. 5.4. The Disability and Mental Health Adviser is responsible for: • Understanding the key responsibilities of respective areas that play a role in supporting disabled staff, and directing queries accordingly. • Coordinating between Health and Safety, HR Partners and DTS in ensuring staff are provided with relevant equipment, technology and furniture following an OH appointment or Access to Work evaluation. • Tracking specific cases and ensuring that the employee is kept regularly updated and informed of progress. • Carrying out regular case reviews and reporting key themes to the Disability and Accessibility Steering Group. • Escalating concerns regarding an individual case to the Director of Human Resources or, where necessary, the COO. • Reviewing monthly caseload with the Director of Human Resources and COO. • Providing confidential advice to staff and managers concerning disability support. • Providing specialist support to HR Partners in addressing disability issues. • Promoting best practice regarding disabi lity support across the School. 5.5. Human Resources (HR) are responsible for: • Providing appropriate advice and support to managers and employees. 5 • Seeking specialist advice (such as via an Occupational Health referral) as required to inform reasonable adjustments for disabled staff. • Retaining, monitoring and reporting on disability data in confidence. 5.6. Other key services and their responsibilities include: • Health and Safety for owning the design and process of workstation risk assessments, which inform more general support for staff (e.g. ensuring an ergonomic desk set -up). • DTS for supporting the provision of additional technologies to support individuals with disabilities (where applicable and approved by the relevant budget holder). • Estate s for monitoring access requirements for staff (and other individuals) on campus, and for implementing updates to access requirements as required Estates also support the implementation of Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs), typically in consultat ion with the individual staff member and their line manager. • Staff Counselling for helping and advising disabled staff who approach them, both for work - based issues and situations relating to personal circumstances. • Other teams around the School may also have a role to play, depending on an individual’s role and staff group, e.g. the Timetables Office provides timetabling support to academic staff. 5.7. In addition to the above, other members of staff – such as trade union safety representatives and staff net work representatives - play a role towards a more supportive environment for disabled staff as well as contributing in specific cases. 5.8. The School also uses external services to provide additional support and advice which inform the management of disability (such as Occupational Health) as well as general wellbeing (such as the School’s Employee Assistance Programme). 6. Policy principles 6.1. The School is committed to creating an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all staff and to addressing the barriers to inclusion that adversely impact upon disabled people. In addition to supporting disabled staff in their current roles, this al so means taking positive steps to ensure that disability is not a barrier to progression in employment. 6.2. All managers and staff have a role to play in ensuring that disabled individuals are treated with dignity and respect. In particular, managers and sta ff should be mindful that some employees may not wish to share information about a disability and some employees may have disabilities that are not immediately apparent. All staff should avoid using language that could be potentially stigmatising or demean ing to disabled staff. All staff who experience distress, on the basis of a disability or for any other reason, will be supported appropriately through the line -management structure, HR or by referral to appropriate supporting services (such as Staff Couns elling). 6.3. The School considers its reasonable adjustment duty as fundamental to creating an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all. Reasonable adjustments for disabled staff should be relevant to their individual needs, appropriate, inclusive a nd in accordance with the School’s policies and procedures as well as equality legislation (including the Equality Act 2010). 6 6.4. The School endeavours to offer an environment where employees feel comfortable sharing information about a disability and asking for reasonable adjustments. Staff are not obliged to notify the School that they have a disability, although it may be in their interests to do this so that reasonable adjustments can be discussed and implemented. The School also recognises that not all d isabilities are identified at the start of an individual’s employment, and some staff may experience and/or share information about a disability at a later stage. It is also recognised that certain conditions are likely to fluctuate and may change over tim e. The School will follow a similar process for discussing, identifying and implementing reasonable adjustments to support staff whenever an employee shares information about a disability or the line manager reasonably believes that the employee may be fac ing disability -related barriers at work. 6.5. All disability information is kept confidentially in accordance with the School’s data protection procedures and GDPR obligations. Information relating to individual cases is only shared on a strictly ‘need to kno w’ basis, for example where information needs to be shared to support the effective implementation of a reasonable adjustment. This may include third parties, such as Occupational Health and other medical professionals. Wider demographic information regard ing disability in the staff community may be shared in accordance with GDPR principles as well as any data sharing agreements that may be in place, such as with the School’s recognised trade unions. 6.6. The School will use a number of means to raise disability awareness within the School community, including through the School’s Staff Networks, focused wellbeing initiatives for staff and collaborative staff -student projects. The School will also seek to raise disability awareness with external organisations with whom the School is in regular contact, such as via the Supplier Code of Practice. 7. Sharing information about a disability 7.1. The School endeavours to offer an environment which encourages employees with a disability or long -term condition to feel comfortable sharing this information as part of an open and supportive workplace culture. Sharing information about a disability enabl es the School to inform staff about the support options available and to put in place reasonable adjustments that minimise any disadvantage and contribute towards a positive employment experience. 7.2. Telling the School information about a disability is at t he employee’s discretion and no employee should feel obliged to share information about a condition if they do not wish to do so. Where staff choose not to share new information or do not give consent for information to be shared for the purposes of suppor t, there will be restrictions or limitations on the level of support and the nature of reasonable adjustments that the School can offer. In particular, staff should note that, if they choose not to share information about a disability or any barriers they are facing at work, it may be difficult for the School to put effective and appropriate adjustments in place. This is also the case for implementing a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) for employees who may need support in evacuating a campus build ing in an emergency. 7.3. An employee may decide to tell the School if they have a disability during recruitment or as part of their induction process. Current staff may choose to tell the School about a disability at any time via MyView (the School’s online self -service portal for staff ) and/or in conversation with their line manager or HR Partner. 7 7.4. Where an employee tells the School that they have a disabili ty, the first step should be a supportive and collaborative conversation between the employee and their line manager to discuss adjustments (see 8. Reasonable adjustments). Any personal information shared during the conversation (or subsequently) will be treated in confidence. 7.5. In rare instances, circumstances may require the School to lift confidentiality. Any lifting of confidentiality will be made on a strictly ‘need t o know’ basis and the employee will be informed, except in cases where: • There is a legal obligation to lift confidentiality without discussion with the staff member, and/or • The health and safety of the staff member or others may be adversely affected by no t doing so. 8. Reasonable adjustments 8.1. The School will consider and implement reasonable adjustments to facilitate inclusion, remove barriers and contribute towards a positive staff experience. Reasonable adjustments are evidence- based and are normally the product of constructive discussions be tween the employee and their line manager, in conjunction with independent supporting information (such as a consultant letter, medical report, Access to Work assessments etc.). Additional factors may also be taken into account, such as the employee’s working (or home) environment, the services provided by the School, and principles of employment law to prevent substantial disadvantage. 8.2. What is ‘reasonable’ will depend on the situation. In particular, it needs to be considered whether a potential adjustmen t: • Will remove or reduce the disadvantage for the individual with the disability • Is practical to make • Is affordable (taking into account both funding available through the School and external sources, e.g. Access to Work) • Could harm the health and safety of others While adjustments are often intended to support an individual in undertaking the core requirements of their role, they should not replace or discard those requirements. For example, while a disabled employee could be given more time to undertake a piece of work, it may not be considered reasonable to remove the need for that piece of work to be undertaken. 8.3. The line manager should be open, responsive and willing to trial different arrangements in order to address the staff member’s needs efficiently. Adjustments may differ depending upon both the employee’s individual circumstances as well as the nature of their role and staff group (for example, they may be different for academic and professional service staff). To assist the employee, line manag er and HR Partner in exploring what adjustments are appropriate, the School has developed a Reasonable Adjustments Flowchart. 8.4. Where specialist advice is required, this should first be discussed with the employee before a referral is made to a specialist, with support from the HR Partner. Where there is a delay in specialist advice being provided (for example where a disability has only recently become apparent), the line manager should work with the employee to explore appropriate and reasonable options t o support them until such advice has been received. 8 8.5. Where an employee has only recently acquired their disability or the employee and line manager are unsure what adjustments are needed, further discussions, as well as input from other areas – such as HR, Health and Safety, as well as external experts – may be necessary as the employee (and School) learns over time what adjustments they require. 8.6. Staff who have been living with disabilities for a long time are likely to have considerable knowledge about their condition as well as a clear idea of what their needs are. It may also be helpful for medical personnel or other specialists who are already treating or working with the disabled employee to input into the process. 8.7. Examples of reasonable adjustmen ts include, but are not limited to: • Making reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process (such as providing extra time during an interview or assessment) • Making reasonable adjustments to the physical environment, e.g. widening a doorway or buildin g a ramp • Exploring flexible working hours, either on a long -term or more temporary basis • Acquiring or modifying equipment, e.g. providing an adapted keyboard • Providing assistive software, as required for the role (such as speech -to-text software) • Where pos sible, providing information in alternative accessible formats (such as large print, audio or Braille) • In the case of academic and teaching staff, scheduling classes and/or rooms appropriately so that the needs of both students and the academic staff membe r can be met as far as reasonably possible • Supporting employees who become disabled, or whose disability leads to an absence from work, with a phased return (e.g. working flexible hours). • Allowing staff time off to attend medical appointments. 8.8. Reasonable adjustments are not set in stone and should be reviewed periodically (and as required by circumstances) by the line manager, in conjunction with the employee and other advice as appropriate (e.g. from HR) to ensure that they are necessary and su fficient. Reviews should be undertaken in a timely manner and at intervals agreed with the employee. Reviews should aim to identify the most appropriate support for the employee – taking into account both the initial assessment as well as any changes that have occurred in the intervening period – and they should be constructive, with the aim of minimising uncertainty and/or distress. 8.9. The School acknowledges that the nature of academia means that additional and/or different support may be appropriate for d isabled individuals in academic roles. Such staff manage their own workload so that they have time both for activities that are scheduled at specific times (such as teaching duties, office hours or meetings with colleagues, LSE citizenship duties etc.) and research time which is essential both to their own professional development and the School. In seeking to balance these commitments, it is highly important that disabled staff are not unfairly disadvantaged, e.g. through absence, illness or another impact of their disability. As such, reasonable adjustments for academic staff with disabilities and/or chronic health conditions need to enable them to participate as fully as is practicable in all aspects of their roles as well as the wider life of the School. This might include support in adjusting an individual’s workload to enable them to focus on all aspects of their academic role. 9 8.10. Further guidance on reasonable adjustments can be found in the Guidance for Managers on Reasonable Adjustments. 9. Technolo gical support for disabled staff 9.1. The School is committed to providing inclusive technology which enables all staff, including those with disabilities, to work, collaborate and interact effectively. As part of this commitment, the School invests in assisti ve technologies that make information (whether online or on paper) more accessible for individuals with disabilities. 9.2. Staff can request a consultation with DTS to discuss bespoke solutions for their individual needs. Solutions may include text -to-speech screen readers, voice recognition software, screen magnification software, and ergonomic keyboards and mice. Staff can contact tech.support@lse.ac.uk to book a consultation or if they have general accessibility queries. 10. Access to Work 10.1. Access to Work is a government fund run by the Department of Work and Pensions which provides support to disabled people to help them overcome work- related obstacles r esulting from their disability. An Access to Work grant can pay for a person’s practical support if they have a disability, health or mental health condition that makes it hard for them to do parts of their job or get to and from work. The money does not have to be paid back and will not affect any other benefits that the individual is receiving. 10.2. Where appropriate, the School may ask an employee to make an application to Access to Work to support funding where reasonable adjustments are extensive and/or ongoing. 10.3. More information about how the scheme works, including eligibility criteria, can be f ound on the Access to Work webpages. 11. Disability and recruitment 11.1. The School aims to recruit, train, develop and retain talented staff, regardless of any protected characteristic, including disability. Ap plicants have an opportunity to share information about a disability on the ‘equal opportunities’ part of their application. This information is retained by HR and is not available to view by the recruitment panel. 11.2. The School is a member of the Disability Confident scheme, under which applicants who consider themselves to be disabled may request a guaranteed interview provided that they meet the essential criteria for the role in question. Progression through the membership scheme is a key part of the School’s plans to enhance the support available to disabled individuals across the LSE community. 11.3. The School will endeavour to make all reasonable adjustments that are requested during a recruitment process to enable a disabled candidate to participate fully. If invited for interview, the applicant will be asked if they require any reasonable adjustments to attend. 10 11.4. Applicants are welcome to visit the campus to enable them to better identify their potential support needs; existing staff are also welcome to visit other departments if are considering applying (or have applied) for another role via an internal recruitmen t process. 11.5. Information on disability support will be made available to new starters at the School as part of their induction materials. 12. Disability and sickness absence 12.1. Staff can self- certify their absence as disability -related through MyView. Absence which is related to a disability is (and must be) recorded and managed s eparately from other categories of sickness absence. Disability -related absence must be treated as unique to the individual and must be managed on a case by case basis, i.e. the way in which an individual’s situation is managed does not in itself create a precedent for how the situations of others should be managed. 12.2. It is acknowledged that disability -related absence may be planned (for example, in the case of medical appointments) and unplanned (for example, where work pressures induce an aggravation of a disability). While any disability -related absence will still form (a separate) part of an employee’s overall absence record, such absences are in themselves an opportunity for the line manager (with HR support as appropriate) to work with the employee to identify any further adjustments or support that could be put in place. 12.3. Staff with ongoing disabilities may require ongoing treatment and time off to attend medical appointments (which may include disability -related programmes, such as pain management). Employees should discuss their need to attend such medical appointments with their line manager as early as possible. Where possible, staff should try to make appointments at the beginning or end of their normal working day. Part -time staff and shift worker s should try to schedule appointments for when they are not working. In line with the School’s sickness absence procedures, such appointments are not recorded as sickness absence unless they require more than half a day away from work. 12.4. Medical appointme nts related to disability (or any other condition) will be accommodated wherever reasonably possible. Managers and employees are expected to be as flexible as possible in ensuring that relevant medical treatment is received, as well as agreeing how any work gaps may be addressed. 12.5. Where an employee’s absence record (including any disability -related absences) is having a significant impact on their attendance and/or performance in their role and recommended reasonable adjustments have been explored, the Capability Health Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff (or equivalent procedure for other staff groups) may apply. Implementation of the latter procedure may happen alongside the ad dressing of any other concerns that have been raised (such as those relating to health and safety, or discrimination and bullying related to disability). 13. Ill health retirement 11 13.1. Where an employee’s health has deteriorated to the extent that they can no longer perform their duties, and all reasonable efforts to redesign their role or secure redeployment have been unsuccessful, retirement on the grounds of ill health will be considered if the employee is a member of one of the School’s pension schemes. An application for ill health retirement will be referred to the HR Pensions team. All applications will need to be supported by appropriate medical reports, which individuals will be required to obtain and authorise for release to the pension scheme Trustee. In these circumstances, the School will support the employee as far as possible with their application, although it is ultimately the decision of the pension scheme Trustee whether to approve individual applications. In the event that an application is rejected, the process will revert to the relevant capability health procedure. 14. Training and development 14.1. The School endeavours to provide the appropriate training and development to all staff to enable them to undertake their roles effectively and to progress both their personal and professional development. As part of this commitment, the School will aim to ensure that all managers are better trained in how to address and manage disability issues in their teams, through additions to the core training programme offered to staff as well as tailored sessions for line managers. 14.2. All staff attending a training programme or course are asked if they have any access requirements or other reasonable adjustments that need to be accommodated. Where in- person training is arranged, this is normally held in accessible venues with considerat ion of the needs of disabled staff, including larger print handouts for those with visual impairments, or printed on different coloured paper to assist those with scotopic sensitivity. 14.3. In addition to specific discussions about reasonable adjustments, con versations about wellbeing in general (and disability in particular where relevant) should be part of one- to-one meetings and catch- ups between employees and managers. For professional services staff, wellbeing discussions have been incorporated into the a vailable guidance on the Career Development Review (CDR) process, including the setting of wellbeing- specific objectives. Similar expecta tions apply to manager -employee discussions among academic, research and teaching staff. 15. Safe access requirements on campus 15.1. The School aims to continually improve the accessibility of its campus and facilities for the benefit of all who work, study or visit. This includes: • Providing suitable access to School buildings via lifts and ramps. • Reviewing and improving existing facilities, e.g. installing automatic doors that provide hands - free entry or maintaining accessible toilets. • Designing, publishing and reviewing fire evacuation procedures for each School building. 15.2. Where requested by an employee and/or advised by medical advice, a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) may be completed by a Fire Safety Advisor, with the employee’s coope ration. PEEPs set out the specific arrangements to support anyone who, due to the nature 12 of a physical or other condition, cannot safely evacuate from a building, acknowledge or respond to a fire signal without being assisted. In addition to visible physic al disabilities, this may also include cognitive or psychological conditions (such as epilepsy or autism) that may impact upon a person’s ability to evacuate the building in an emergency. More details about PEEPs, as well as other provisions supporting saf e evacuation procedures, can be found in the Policy for Safe Evacuation of Persons with Disabilities. 15.3. A number of accessible parking bays are available near LSE’s main (Houghton Street) campus. This parking is provided under the ‘Blue Badge’ scheme which provides special parking rights for vehicles carrying drivers or passengers with disabilities. There are also additional ‘Blue Badge’ parking bays on Portugal Street and Sardinia Street. Further information on accessible parking and other transport options can be found on the LSE website. External advice on transport support services for disabled people is available on the UK government’s webpages. 16. Raising a concern 16.1. Where staff feel that they have not been treated in line with the principles within this policy, they have a number of options available to them for raising their concerns, whether these relate to local or central support. 16.2. Staff are encouraged to raise concerns with their line manager or HR Partner in the first instance. If this does not result in a satisfactory response, or they do not feel comfortable in doing so, they should approach the School’s Disability and Mental He alth Adviser. 16.3. The School is also able to support staff in resolving concerns through mediation; staff can find out more about this from their HR Partner. 17. Discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation 17.1. The School is committed to a working and learning environment where people can achieve their full potential free from any form of discrimination, harassment or bullying. Discrimination and harassment are not limited to people with a disability but may also apply to those associated with a disability, e.g. associative discrimination in the case of a carer for a disabled child. 17.2. Harassment may take the form of verbal abuse or other actions that make an individual feel uncomfortable, intimidated or degraded. Discrimination is defined as when someone is treated less favourably or put at a disadvantage because of one or more of their protected characteristics. Discrimination may be direct or indirect. In addition, another category of discrimination is discrimination arising out of a disability, which oc curs when a disabled individual is treated unfavourably because of something connected with their disability and there is no justification for this treatment; there is no need for comparison with another individual for this type of discrimination. 17.3. Miscon duct which is unintentionally detrimental towards disabled individuals may, where appropriate, be addressed and resolved informally. Where behaviour is more serious, intentional 13 and/or deliberate, formal procedures are applicable (e.g. disciplinary procedu re where an allegation is made against another employee). 17.4. Appendix 2 of the School’s Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Policy provides a list of internal and external contacts that staff can contact if they feel that they have been subject to discriminatory treatment on the basis of disability. This includes the Safe Contacts network, the Report It Stop It online form, and/or their HR Partner. 18. Monitoring and reporting 18.1. The School is legally required under the Equality Act 2010 to monitor and report annually its disability disclosure figures for staff and students. These figures are collected via individual staff records (both during recruitment and for current staff), st udent admission data and student records. Statistics on staff are also reported in the annual University Equality Monitoring Report as well as HESA student returns. 18.2. The School will continue to collect and monitor these statistics, as well as taking steps to encourage employees to feel comfortable sharing their data as part of its commitment to an inclusive working environment. Early sharing of information about a disability is encouraged so that reasonable adjustments can be put in place as early as possible. 18.3. All reporting on disability data will be anonymous in nature and no individuals will be identified. Information on staff who share information about a disability will be kept confidentially on the appropriate data system, in line with the School’s Data Protection Policy and UK GDPR obligations. 19. Further resources 19.1. The School’s Disability and Wellbeing Staff Network (DAWN) aims to make the School more disability confident and raise awareness about disability on campus. Staff ar e encouraged to contact edi@lse.ac.uk if they have any questions or wish to be part of the network. 19.2. The School’s Disability and Wellbeing Steering Group is chaired by the Pro -Director (Education) and meets periodically to discuss disability -related matters that affect staff and students. 19.3. More information on assistive technologies can be found on the Assistive Tech webpage. 19.4. Further information on workstation risk assessments that inform more general support options for staff is available on the Health and Safety webpages. 19.5. The trade unions recognised by the School can provide advice in individual cases and general support, as well as being a means for wider concerns about the emp loyment experience of disabled staff to be raised. In addition, in line with UK law2, union- appointed safety representatives make an important and practical contribution to the health and safety of staff. 2 Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 14 19.6. General wellbeing support for staff can be acces sed through: • Staff wellbeing webpages • Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) which provides confidential telephone counselling and more as a 24/7 service • Staff Counselling Services 19.7. The School is a member of the Business Disability Forum, a not -for-profit membership organisation which provides (among oth er resources) networking opportunities, access to disability guidance and an Advice Service. 20.

       "  'text': '1 1. Purpose 1.1 This p olicy describes the School -wide policy and procedure for Named Chairs without external funding. The aim is to provide a clear and rigorous policy for the conditions under which ‘names’ can be attached to full professorial posts. 1.2 In certain disciplines, Named Chairs are regarded as a signal of prestige. In some Departments, their use can be helpful as part of an overall recruitment or retention package. The policy should provide criteria and a process for conferring Named Chairs without external funding and across the School. 2. Scope 2.1 The policy may apply to all Departments in the School that are considering attaching a ‘name’ to a full professorial post held by a specific individual, until that individual leaves the School. No Department is required to take advantage of this policy. 2.2 The policy is only concerned with approving names for full profe ssorial posts funded internally by the School. 3. Criteria for the Creation of New Named Chairs without External Funding 3.1 A full professorial post may be ‘named’ in the School according to the following criteria: i. The named individual has a demonstrated conn ection with the School; Named Chair s without External Funding Policy and Procedure Academic 2 ii. The named individual is deemed to have had a prestigious scholarly record or was a public figure who is held in high esteem; iii. Whether there is or is not a similarly Named Chair at another University (predominantly UK and US institutions) and a risk assessment of this concluding that the name should be added to an LSE list of Named Chairs; iv. The named individual or, if the named individual is deceased, the named individual’s next of kin, as appropriate, have been contacted and are suppor tive. 3.2 Proposals are expected to be consistent with the School’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Policy Statement, specifically in relation to ways in which to recognise the importance and value of attracting, retaining and developing talented academic staff from a variety of different backgrounds. 3.3 In order to sustain the prestige associated with conferring a Named Chair, it is expected that there will normally be no more than 30 Named Chairs without external funding on the School- wide approved register. This represents around 11% of 260 full Professorial posts in the School on 1 May 2019. Named Chairs should only be awarded in truly exception al circumstances. 4. Procedure 4.1 In the first year that the policy takes effect, the procedure will be as follows: o A call will be made for proposals from Heads of Department so that there is a register of approved names ready to be conferred when a Department elects to attach a name to a full Professorial post in the School. o Proposals will be considered by the School’ s Centennial Professor Selection Committee. 4.2 All proposals for a new Name will be submitted to Human Resources with a brief explanation of the rationale for each Name and the way it meets the first four criteria. The proposal should note that the Name(s) h as/have been discussed with Advancement and confirm that there is no immediate plan to seek external funding with respect to the Name. This does not preclude Advancement fundraising for the Name at a future time which would be subject to the relevant contr ols in the Donations Acceptance Policy. 4.3 Should the Name receive provisional approval, the proposers will contact the named individual or, where the named individual is deceased, the named individual’s next of kin to seek their agreement. When agreement is reached, HR will be notified and the proposal will receive final approval from the Di rector or the Pro -Director Faculty Development in his/her absence. 5. Arrangements for Awarding Named Chairs 5.1 After a Department has gained approval for the use of a ‘name’ for a Named Chair, subsequently, a Department may propose consideration of one of th ese ‘names’ in response to a specific recruitment or retention case and the case for the name will be considered by the School’s Centennial Professor Selection Committee, normally via electronic circulation due to the time 3 sensitive nature of recruitment o r retention cases of relevance. The reason for involving the School’s Centennial Professor Committee is to have an independent check on the distinction of candidates. The Committee will not be involved where an open recruitment search is undertaken for a Named Chair that was advertised as a Named Chair. 5.2 All approved names under this policy will: o Be owned by the School and conferred on an individual as part of the School’s normal recruitment procedures or as part of a package aimed at retaining existing sta ff; o Revert to the School when the individual upon whom the name is conferred departs; o Thereafter, the name may be conferred on an individual with a different departmental affiliation to the previous incumbent. 6. Review 6.1 An approved register of names will be maintained by HR and reviewed every three years. 6.2 The policy will be reviewed annually by the Appointments Committee in line with normal practice. 4 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 12 months July 2020 May 2020 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 June 2016 Appointments Committee 2 June 2019 Appointments Committee Links Reference Link EDI Statement Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Policy Statement Contacts Position Name Email Notes Human Resources Review and Promotion Team Hr.Reviewandpromotion @lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': '1 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE (‘the School’) is committed to ongoing learning and development as a means of attracting and retaining high -quality staff. As part of this commitment, the School promotes and encourages secondments as career development opportunities. This policy sets out the School’s position on secondments and the principles that apply to them. 1.2. Secondments are one of the ways in which current employees may explore career development opportunities beyond their substantive post. This policy may be read alongside information about job shadowing and mentoring, as well as other options such as ‘Projects as Learning’ (PAL) days and Responsibility Allowances. 1.3. This policy is supported by a number of resources, including : • Secondments webpage • Guidance for managers, including offering and managing a secondment, and supporting employees on secondments • Guidance for staff on applying for and working secondments 2. Scope 2.1. This policy applies to all professional services staff on bands 1 -10 who have passed their review period. For any individual seconded to the School from an external organisation, the terms and conditions of their secondment will be confirmed prior to commencement. 2.2. A seconded employee moves fully into an entirely different post and is not required to fulfil the responsibilities of their substanti ve post during the secondment. For p artial and temporary changes to an employee’s substantive post, and the financial recognition these changes may attract, please see the Responsibility Allowances Guidance. 2.3. Secondme nts are a formal change to an individual’s contract of employment. This policy does not therefore cover ad -hoc ar rangements for unplanned or short -term cover of a role. Secondment Policy for Professional Services Staff Operational 2 2.4. From 31 October 2019, a pplication of this policy will be in line with the School’s anonymised applications process, which applies to the recruitment of professional services roles. 3. Definitions 3.1. The term ‘secondment’ is used to broadly cover the temporary move of an employee to a different post or different part of the School for a defined period of time ( the expected duration of which is set out below ). Secondments differ from other fixed -term co ntracts in that the employee normally has the right to return to their substantive role after the secondment ends, unless their substantive role no longer exists due to organisational change in which case the employee may be considered for redeployment. 3.2. The term ‘substantive role/post’ refers to the role /post an employee is in prior to a secondment. 4. Duration 4.1. Secondments are for a defined period of time which may subsequently be extended, with the agreement of all parties involved. Secondments will normally last for between three and twelve months in total, inclusive of any extensions. Secondments of a longer duration will only be approved in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of an HR Partner. 4.2. A vacancy of less than three months’ duration will normally be impractical as a secondment, given induction and training considerations. A manager with a vacancy of less than three months can speak with the HR Partnering team about options for filling the vacancy. 4.3. A vacancy of more than twelve month s’ initial duration will normally be unsuitable for a secondment, since by the end of that time the employee will no rmally have developed beyond their original role. Where such vacancies are available, employees may of course apply but they will normally have no right of return to their substantive role. 5. Respon sibilities 5.1. Employees are responsible for: • taking an active interest in their own career development by exploring and discussing opportunities through both manager -empl oyee discussions and the CDR process • discussing secondment possibilities with their line manager before applying 3 • maintaining regular contac t with their substantive line manager (and substantive employer in the case of an external se condment) during a secondment • discussing their exp erience of the secondment as part of the transition back into their substantive role, and in subsequent o ne-to-ones and CDRs as relevant. 5.2. Managers are responsible for: • encouraging the use of secondments as development opportunities, assisting employees to find appropriate opportunities, exploring the options for (and benefits of) secondments, and supporting secondments in principle • managing secondments in line with this Policy a nd any supporting documentation, including the relevant sections of the Secondment Toolkit that detail managerial responsibilities at each step of the secondment process • informing HR of secondments and seeking advice as appropriate during the managem ent of secondments, including any extensions • consid ering all secondment requests fairly and, where business reasons do not support a secondment, working with an employee to explore other development options • liaising with other managers as appropriate so that both the secondee’s substantive and seconded posts are managed effectively, and there is an appropriate transition at th e start and end of a secondment. 5.3. HR are responsible for: • advising managers, where appropriate, about the recruitment and management of secondments, including extensi ons • supporting managers in arranging cover during secondme nts and otherwise supporting managers so that there is no adverse effect on operations • ensuring that, where necessary, secondment opportuniti es are advertised and filled through the ap propriate recruitment processes • issuing documentation relating to secondments and retaining copies. 6. Types of secondment 6.1. This policy recognises three types of secondment: a) Internal Secondments (same Division /Department/Centre/Institute ) are where an employee is seconded to another post within the same division as their substantive role. 4 b) Internal Secondments (outside Division /Department/Centre/Institute ) are where an employee is seconded to another post outside the same division as their substantive role. c) External Secondments are where the School reaches agreement with an external organisation regarding the secondment of an individual for a defined period of time – this will either be a School employee being seconded to the external organisation, or an individual coming in from outside the School. There is a separate External Secondment Procedure which sets out the process for recruiting and managing external secon dments. 6.2. The HR Partnering team can advise the recruiting manager about the most appropriate type of arrangemen t to fill a particular vacancy. 7. Principles 7.1. Secondments are a valuable way for employees to enhance their career development by experiencing another rol e for a defined period of time. At the same time, secondments also expand skill sets across the School and effectively address both shorter and longer term vacancies. 7.2. Managers are encouraged to consider potential secondments posit ively and with the aim of supporting the career development of their employees. Approval will normally only be withheld where: • Approving the secondment would present sign ificant resourcing difficulties, or • The proposed secondment does not fit with the employee’s development needs, in which case the manager should work with the employee to explore other learning and development options, or • There is an ongoing performance/disciplinary process. There is no ri ght of appeal against a decision not to approve a secondment. 7.3. Any fixed -term vacancy may be considered a potential secondment opportunity, except where the post carries an exceptional level of specialist knowledge which an employee from another area of work could not reasonably be expected to learn within a secondmen t period. Secondments are most often appropriate to provide cover in the case of long -term absence (e.g. maternity leave) or to undertake a role on a fixed -term basis (e.g. work on a particular project). 7.4. Where a seconded (i.e. fixed -term) post subsequently becomes permanent, the secondee may be offered the role on a permanent basis provided that: • They have been performing to a satisfactory level, and • Their substantive line manager is happy that the substantive role will b e adequately covered, and • The secondee was initially offered the secondment as part of a normal recruitment process (i.e. was not ‘placed’ into the role). 5 7.5. Employees maintain their continuous service and annual leave entitlement during secondments. Any pay award s or increases will continue to be made to the substantive post during a secondment, so that the employee returns to the same terms and conditions that would have applied had the secondment not occurred. 7.6. There is no limit to the number of secondment s employees may apply for or work, as long as they follow the relevant procedure. 7.7. Employees normally retain the right to return to their substantive role at the end of a secondment; this will enable them to develop their skills while being confident of their substantive employment. An employee will be consulted in the normal way if thei r substantive post is affected by organisational changes during their secondment. Where a return to the same role is not possible (e.g. in the case of an organisational restructure), as in all cases, efforts will be made to find alternative employment. Whe re an employee’s substantive role is fixed -term and ends during their secondment, they will be given notice before the end of the secondment and will become eligible for redeployment as set out in the Redeployment Policy. 7.8. A secondment will normally end on the agreed end date, at which point the employee is expected to return to their substantive post with its terms and conditions. The secondment will only end early where: • It is agreed by all parties to end the secondment early and return the secondee to t heir substantive role, or • In the case of an internal secondment or a Secondment Out, the secondee gives notice in line with their substantive contract of em ployment (or the notice period for their seconded role if this is greater), or • The seconded role is itself ended, e.g. as a result of organisational change, in which case the employee will normally return to their substantive role or (where this is not possible) they will be considered for redeployment. 7.9. This policy and procedure will be implemented f airly, reasonably and in line with the School’s guidance on Equi ty, Diversity and Inclusion. 6 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years July 20 21 April 2021 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 July 2018 JNICC None Links Reference Link Secondments webp age https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human -Resources/Organisational -learning/PSS - Career -Development/Secondments Guidance for Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human - Resources/Assets/Documents/Secondments/Guidance -for-staff-web.pdf Guidan ce for Ma nagers: suppo rting employees on secondments https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human - Resources/Assets/Documents/Secondments/Supporting -Employees -on- Secondments -web.pdf Guidance for Managers: offering and managing a secondment https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human - Resources/Assets/Documents/Secondments/Offering -and-Managing -a-Secondment - web.pdf Contacts Position Name Email Notes HR Policy Adviser Kieran Darling k.darling1@lse.ac.uk None Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': ' December 2018 Staff Mental Health and Wellbeing Policy Introduction The School commits to providing an inclusive workplace where the physical, social, emotional and mental wellbeing of staff enables them to achieve their full potential and thrive at work. By fostering a working environment that supports employees’ wellbeing at work, the School aims to deliver a positive employee experience that engenders commitment and loyalty as well as enabl ing personal and collective success. It is recognised that committed staff, who feel supported in the workplace and have a strong sense of belonging, are integral to the success of the LSE Strategy 2030. The School seeks to support all strands of wellbei ng in the workplace, whilst recognising that mental and emotional wellbeing can underpin much of a person’s sense of wellness. As such, developing a School environment that understands we all have mental health that will fluctuate over time, just as we al l have physical health that will change, is at the heart of this policy. Policy aims Our commitment is to: \\uf0b7 Actively create and promote the conditions for wellness, taking into account the individualised nature of social, physical, emotional and mental needs. \\uf0b7 Create a positive, healthy and inclusive working environment where individuals are supported to perform to the best of their abilities and, through this, will be resilient and adaptable in the face of change. \\uf0b7 Develop line managers to understand how wellbeing impacts upon healthy, happy and productive teams, whilst equipping them to support their staff as their mental, emotional and/or physical health needs change or are disclosed. \\uf0b7 Ensure that risk factors leading to workplace stress are minimised or mitigated, putting support in place for individuals who are experiencing a high degree of stress irrespective of the reduction of risk. \\uf0b7 Foster a personal and shared responsibility for wellbeing, with all individuals in the School community contributing pos itively towards the School environment through their behaviours, words and deeds, and in accordance with the School’s Ethics Code. Policy principles The working environment at LSE will be one where staff: a) Can work safely, comfortably and with minimal risk to their health b) Feel valued and supported c) Have an appropriate work -life balance d) Are confident that their health and wellbeing matter to the LSE e) Feel confident, equipped and supported to demonstrate resilience and respond flexibly and positively to bot h temporary increases in demand and an evolving work environment f) Are provided with advice, support and a working environment that encourages healthy lifestyle choices g) Feel able to seek support from their line manager, work colleagues or other sources of as sistance in relation to stress and other mental health issues.  December 2018 We will progress the wellbeing policy through a detailed action plan [ link] underpinned by the following key themes: 1. Collaborating with key internal and external partners to create a shared understanding of wellbeing in the workplace and to develop appropriate wellbeing interventions. 2. Promoting better social, physical and mental wellbeing through an improved bank of information resou rces and encouraging participation in healthy initiatives at individual, team and School levels. 3. Training and supporting our leaders and managers to manage staff effectively and create a healthy working environment. 4. Creating a community of wellbeing volunt eers to develop and co -ordinate a range of ‘grassroots’ wellbeing initiatives, whilst providing opportunities for the wider School community to contribute ideas and to engage and connect with other members of staff.

Policy Statement 1.1 The School is committed to a working and learning environment where people can achieve their full potential free from any form of discrimination, harassment or bullying and is committed to providing an inclusive culture of equality, diversity and respect between individuals. 1.2 This Policy outlines the School’s vision in creating an d maintaining a healthy environment where its members are confident that any complaints raised by them in relation to any form of discrimination, harassment and bullying will be dealt with fairly, diligently and promptly. It is also committed to providing a supportive culture which encourages the reporting of such incidents/behaviour and early intervention. 1.3 The School recognises the need to challenge any tacit or explicit acceptance of discrimination, harassment or bullying in order to prevent escalation and is therefore dedicated to focusing on initiatives that will work to prevent such unacceptable behaviour arising. This includes working to improve the understanding of discrimination, harassment and bullying across the School’s com munity to prevent future such behaviour from occurring as well as taking steps to understand the nature and extent of discrimination, harassment and bullying experienced by members of the LSE community on its premises that goes unreported. 1.4 Appropriate steps will be taken to deal with behaviour, intentional or unintentional, that results in a breach of this Policy and the School’s procedures make provision for the investigation of allegations made and for disciplinary action to be taken where allegations are upheld. 1.4 The School is also committed to protecting and promoting freedom of speech within the law and as such this Discrimination, Harassment and Bulling Policy operates in accordance with the School’s Code of Practice on Free Speech. The School is also committed to academic freedom and critical analysis within the law, for academic staff to be able to question, challenge and debate new ideas and opinions. There are instances where this may be limited by law where it is necessary to prevent crime, for national security purposes, public safety or to prevent unlawful discrimination and harassment. The School’s Code of Practice on free speech can be found at: https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies- and-procedures/Assets/Documents/Code -of-Practice - on-Free -Speech.pdf 1.6 For the purposes of this Policy, references to ‘the LSE community’ includes but is not limited to all salaried and non- salaried members of staff (including visiting staff), students and members of council and other members of the School including all those individuals authorised to be on School Premises for the purposes of work or study. 2. Scope of this Policy 2.1 The School will not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment or bullying within its community or against its members, including but not limited to that which takes place beyond the physical premises and normal business hours of the School, suc h as conduct at School events, social events related to work or studies, trips abroad and/or on social media. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy will apply to any such behaviour arising abroad and in relation to the School’s overseas 3 activities. 2.2 It also applies to members of the LSE c ommunity who may be working remotely and engaging with others remotely via an online platform. The way individuals within the LSE c ommunity work or study has become more diversified over time. Members of the LSE c ommunity may be working or studying remotely within their home environment where all communication takes place on an online platform. As such, any discrimination, harassment and bullying via online platforms can make individuals feel more exposed or vulnerable. The impact on an individual may be amplified where their home and work life seem to merge into one and where there is no physical distance between the two. In such circumstances, t he School will take reasonable steps to eliminate discrimination, harassment and bullying and other unacceptable behaviour set out in this Policy which may occur and which may be more magnified within the remote working/learning environment. 2.3 This Policy applies to any behaviour as set out in this Policy perpetrated by students, members of staff, members of council against other students, members of staff, members of C ouncil. It also applies to behaviour committed against any other third party (including but not limited to contractors, alumni, visitors, job/student applicants) where it occurs on premises and/ or where third party contact is made in relation to work/study purposes. The above list is not exhaustive and may also include unacceptable behaviour being perpetrated by any other party who is required by the School to abide by this Policy. The School will also take reasonable steps to prevent any third party harassment (e.g. from a visitor, supplier, member of the public) that may occur against a member of the LSE Community. For the avoidance of doubt, behaviour that may constitute direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and discrimination arising from a disability would normally only be considered as being carried out by the E mployer /Provider (the School), a member of staff or a member of Council. 2.4 The School may also consider third party allegations and/or historic allegations of discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation against a member of the LSE Community that is raised formally with it and where the School assesses that there may be a continued risk to other members of the LSE community. Where possible, reasonable attempts will be made to obtain relevant information to determine an appropriate response. 2.5 The School’s Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Policy is intended to cover instances of harassment and/or violence of a sexual nature. In the event of a conflict between this discrimination, harassment and bullying policy and the Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Policy, the terms of the latter policy will prevail. 2.6 This Policy consists of and includes an: • Appendix 1 which provides examples on the various types of discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation amongst other forms of unacceptable behaviour defined under this Policy; • Appendix 2 which outlines Internal and external contacts and Sources of Support and; • Appendix 3 which se ts out the legislation. 4 3. Responsibility of the LSE Community 3.1 All members of the LSE community should help to: • prevent discrimination, harassment and bullying by being sensitive to the reactions and needs of others, and ensuring that their conduct does not cause offence; • discourage discrimination, harassment and bullying by others by making it clear that such conduct is unacceptable, and supporting colleagues and peers who are taking steps to stop it; • understand what constitutes discrimination, harassment and bullying by attending training sessions and/or seeking advice from the School’s central administration. 3.2 The School is responsible for: • taking reasonable steps to eliminate discrimination, bullying and harassment as well as to actively promote equality to provide a collegiate and harmonious working environment; • taking appropriate action and early intervention when it is aware that discrimination, harassment and bullying may be or is taking place; • Implementing training of member s of staff in relation to discrimination, harassment and bullying • raising awareness to help members of the LSE Community identify and deal with discrimination, harassment and bullying. 3.3 All line managers and others with positions of responsibility have an additional obligation to ensure that this Policy is implemented, to promote equality, an inclusive and non -discriminatory environment, and to tackle swiftly and fairly any discrimin ation, harassment and bullying that is reported to them. 3.4 Unacceptable behaviour as outlined in this Policy is not necessarily confined to the behaviour of senior staff towards more junior staff, or indeed staff towards students; it can take place between individuals at the same level or involve staff or students behaving inappropriately towards more senior members of the School. 3.5 M embers of the LSE community may be personally liable for their actions, which in some instances could lead to criminal or civil action in the Courts under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and The Equality Act 2010 or any other relevant legislation. 4. Definitions For the purposes of this Policy the following definitions apply : Discrimination 4.1 Discrimination is defined under The Equality Act 2010 and takes place when an individual or a group of people are treated less favourably than others based on a protected characteristic such as age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity (including treating a woman unfavourably because she is 5 breastfeeding), race(including colour, nationality, ethnic and national origin), religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation and in relation to direct discrimination only, marriage and civil partnership. Discrimination includes the following categories ; direct discrimination (which includes discrimination by association and perception), indirect discrimination and discrimination arising out of a disability. 4.2 Direct discrimination occurs where an individual is treated less favourably because of one of the protected characteristic(s). In order for someone to show that they have been directly discriminated against, they must compare what has happened to them to the treatment a person without their protected characteristic is receiving or has received. If there is no comparator, it can still be considered direct discrimination if an in dividual can show that another individual who did not have their protected characteristic would have b een treated better in similar circumstances. 4.3 Discrimination by association (other than pregnancy and maternity) refers to a situation where an individual is discriminated against because of the protected characteristic of another individual(s), with whom they are associated. 4.4 Discrimination by perception (other than pregnancy and maternity) is discrimination against an individual because he or she is wrongly perceived to have a certain protected characteristic. 4.5 In relation to pregnancy and maternity, it is discriminatory to treat an individual (including a student) unfavourably because of their pregnancy and any re lated illness or because an individual is seeking to take, taking or taken maternity leave /pay during what is known as ‘the protected period.’ This protected period begins from the start of pregnancy and ends when maternity leave ends or an individual returns to work after giving birth. If an individual is not an employee or worker, the protected p eriod ends two weeks after a child is born. 4.6 Indirect discrimination occurs where an individual is disadvantaged by an unjustified provision, criterion or practice that puts an individual with a particular protected characteristic at a disadvantage compared with others who do not share that characteristic. Any individual claiming indirect discrimination must be able to show that they have been disadvantaged personally or that they will be disadvantaged and it cannot be shown that there is a good reason for applying that specific provision, criterion or practice. For the av oidance of doubt, a provision, criterion or practice can include but is not limited to School policies, ways in which access to any benefit, service or facility is provided and one off decisions. 4.7 Another category of discrimination is discrimination arising out of a disability which occurs when a disabled individual is treated unfavourably because of something connected with their disability and there is no justification for this treatment. The Equality Act 2010 protects a person from being treated badly because of something connected to their disability, such as needing time off for medical appointments. It will not apply if the individual alleged to have committed discrimination arising from disability did not know or could not have reasonably be expected to know that the individual making the allegation had a disability. In the Equality Act 2010, disability means a physical or a mental condition which has a substantial and long -term impact on an individual’s ability to do normal day to day activities. Discrimination arising from disability will occur if the following three conditions are met: • A disabled individual is treated unfavourably, and are therefore at a disadvantage, even if this was not the intention, and 6 • this treatment is because of something connected with the disability (which could be the result, effect or outcome of that disability) and • the treatment cannot be justified by showing that it is ‘a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim’ It is not unlawful discrimination to treat a disabled person more favourably than a non -disabled person if they require it. Under the Equality Act 2010, an employer has certain duties to make ‘reasonable adjustments’. This is to ensure that a disabled person is not put at a substantial disadvantage by the employment/study arrangements or by any physical feature of the workplace or learning environment. There is a responsibility to make sure that disabled people can access jobs, education and services as easily as non- disabled people. This is known as the ‘duty to make reasonable adjustments’. What is reasonable will depend on a number of factors. When discrimination may be lawful and the Occupational Requirement 4.8 The following types of discrimination may be justified in certain circumstances: • indirect discrimination • discrimination because of something connected to an individual’s disability • direct age discrimination. Where the following three circumstances may apply: • Positive action – to help a disadvantaged or underrepresented group ; • objective justification – when an employer can prove a legitimate need for less favourable treatment; • using protected characteristics in recruitment Under the Equality Act 2010, there can be objective justification for discrimination where both of the following apply: · there's a 'legitimate aim', such as a genuine business need or a health and safety need and · the discrimination is 'proportionate, appropriate and necessary' – this means the legitimate aim is more important than any discriminatory effect If discrimination is found to be justified, then it will not be considered unlawful discrimination. There may also be other situations where it is lawful for an employer to require a job to be done by someone with a particular characteristic, if having this characteristic is an occupational requirement for the job. The Equality Act 2010 states all of the following need to be shown for the discrimination to be lawful: 7 • the requirement is an occupational requirement and there must be a link between the requirement and the job • the employer has a good business reason or a legitimate aim for applying the requirement and must be able to show it • having the requirement is the best way to achieve the employer’s aim, it must be proportionate The occupational requirement exception only applies in relation to a decision about: • recruitment - whether or not to offer a job • access to training • promotion or transfer to another job • dismissals Harassment 4.9 Harassment is set out under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the Equality Act 2010. Section 1 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 sets out that: as: ‘A person must not pursue a course of conduct: (a) which amounts to harassment of another, and which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other. Whilst harassment is not defined references to harassment under section 7(2) of the Act inclu de ‘alarming the person or causing the person distress.’ It can include repeated attempts to impose unwanted communications and contact upon another individual(s) in a manner that could be expected to cause distress or fear in any reasonable person. 4.10 Under s 26 of the Equality Act 2010 harassment is defined as unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person ’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. As such, individuals are protected from three types of harassment. Firstly, it is unlawful to treat someone less favourably where it relates to a ‘relevant protected characteristic,’ which for the purposes of harassment includes - age; disability; gender re -assignment; race; religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. For the avoidance of doubt, pregnancy and maternity, marriage and civil partnership are not specifically included within the harassment provisions of the Equali ty Act 2010, although unwanted conduct related to these would be considered as harassment due to sex. In addition to this, an individual may put forward a case for harassment if they do not have the specific protect ed characteristic, but instead have a con nection with the protected characteristic. 4.11 Another form of harassment is Sexual Harassment which occurs when you engage in unwanted conduct or behaviour which is of a sexual nature and which has the purpose of violating an individual’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading or offensive environment. Examples of what may constitute Sexual Harassment are set out in Appendix 1 of this Policy. The School’s Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Policy is intended to cover instances of harassment and/or violence of a sexual nature. 4.12 Harassment may also occur when an individual is treated less favourably because they have rejected or submitted to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature or behaviour that is related to gender identity or sex. 8 4.13 Misogyny is the conscious or unconscious hatred/dislike of, contempt for or ingrained prejudice against women. It can take many forms such as male privilege, patriarchy, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, belittling of women, violence against women and sexual objectification of women. It can also be expressed in many forms including psychological and physical abuse, sexual harassment, and sexual violence. Victimisation 4.13 Victimisation means treating an individual unfavourably (subjecting them to a detriment) because they have done a protected act. A protected act can be: • making a claim or complaint under the Equality Act (for example, for discrimination or harassment)/Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 • helping someone else to make a claim by giving evidence or information • making an allegation that someone has breached the Equality Act, or • doing anything else which may relate to the Equality Act Victimisation also means subjecting an individual to a detriment because it is believed they have done or are going to do a protected act; or giving evidence to support an individual complaining about a protected act; the individual does not actually need to have done the protected act. Bullying 4.14 Bullying is defined as intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or of fensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, or humiliating environment. Bullying usually involves a repeated course of conduct. Bullying does not need to relate to a protected characteristic. 4.15 It may be physical or psychological in nature and conducted in an open environment or a secretive manner. It is behaviour that is often repetitive and intended to dominate another person or group by making them feel degraded, humiliated, intimidated or offended. It can cause a person to lose respect and confidence. Stalking 4.16 Stalking is an offence under English law and is also considered a form of harassment and/or bullying, regardless of whether the perpetrator is known or a stranger to the victim. It is usually persistent and unwanted conduct. It can be physical or psychological and take place directly against a person, or by approaching a third party about a person. Following a person home, pestering them, sending or leaving them unwanted and repeated messages on their telephone or email, bullying them on social media or making intrusive or unwanted visits are examples of how stalking may take place. Hate Crimes, Incidents and Speech 4.17 Hate crimes are any crimes that are perceived to be targeted at an individual because of hostility or prejudice towards that individual’s: disability, race or ethnicity, religion or belief, sexual orientation, 9 transgender identity. 4.18A hate incident is behaviour which is not a crime but which is perceived by the victim, or anybody else, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on the 5 protected characteristics as mentioned in 4.17. When hate incidents become criminal offences they are known as hate crimes and can be prosecuted. 4.19 Hate speech is all forms of speech which spread and justify racial hatred, xenophobia, homophobia/biphobia/transphobia, anti-Semitism or other forms of hatred based on intolerance (Institute for Strategic Dialogue). This includes hate speech directed at others due to their protected characteristics(all protected characteristics as set out in the Equality Act 2010). 4.19 Examples of all of the above definitions are set out in Appendix 1. 5. Harassment and bullying via the internet and/or email and social media sites 5.1 Harassment, bullying and stalking can also take place on the internet and through the misuse of email and social media. This can include but is not limited to the use of social media including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, Snapchat and other platforms, as well as chat rooms and other forums, personal web pages, emails, text messages, Skype, conference calling and other online to ols. This may also occur during online teaching/seminar or any other online meeting that may be arranged and connected to a student’s learning experience. 5.2 When using social media or posting online all members of the LSE Community should consider the content, language and appropriateness of such communications. Use which is deemed unacceptable includes but is not limited to the following: • making and /or sharin g sexually explicit, racist, violent messages and/or offensive messages or other such content via social media • forming or participating in an online group that isolates or victimises fellow students, members of staff and or other members of the LSE community • using social media to access or share illegal content • using language which would be deemed to be offensive, threatening or humiliating to others in a face -to-face setting • Making defamatory comments • Sharing confidential information • Imitating another LSE community member on social media 5.3 Any such unacceptable use can lead to an investigation under the relevant disciplinary procedure. Members of the LSE community are additionally required to comply with the School’s Conditions of Use of IT facilities which can be found at: https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/Services/Policies- and- procedures/Assets/Documents/conOfUseOfITFacAtLSE.pdf 6. Action against discrimination, harassment, victimisation and bullying 6.1 Where it is possible and where there is no risk to safety, the School would always encourage an individual to inform the alleged perpetrator that they find the behaviour directed against them 10 unacceptable and ask them to stop. In some cases, the situation may be resolved in this way. A written record should be kept of all incidents including the details, dates, times, circumstances and witnesses. If the matter is not resolved or the behaviour persists, then an individual should approach the relevant members of the School to escalate the matter as set out under the relevant School procedure. There is also a list of internal contacts set out in Appendix 2. 6.2 Where an allegation is brought forward to be considered formally, the School will conduct confidential and impartial investigations into allegations made. In deciding whether conduct is discrimination, harassment or bullying, the School will take account of the following factors: • the alleged reporting individual’s perception of the conduct • other circumstances of the case; • whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have had the effect of discrimination, harassment or bullying The School will take into consideration any aggravating factors such as unacceptable behaviour arising from an abuse of power from an individual who is in a senior position against an individual who is in a junior position. 6.3 Where an allegation is upheld, this may normally result in disciplinary action which can include dismissal, expulsion or referral to the police in serious cases. The relevant procedures are outlined below: 6.4 For students and members of staff For students : • The Disciplinary Procedure for S tudents: https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies- and-procedures/Assets/Documents/disProStu.pdf For the avoidance of doubt, where a student reports an incident (as outlined under this Policy) against an LSE member of staff, then this will be referred to the LSE Human Resources Division to investigate under their procedures i.e. the Grievance Policy and Procedure for Professional Services staff/ Disciplinary and Dismissal Policy for Professiona l services staff/ Academic Annex Procedure for Academic/Research staff. In relation to student cases, the School and the LSE Students’ Union may use their own separate procedures to investigate and take appropriate action to resolve the same allegation of harassment, discrimination and bullying (i.e. the School considering a student’s status at LSE, the Union considering a student’s membership of its organisation). Aside from banning a student from Students’ Union space, the Students’ Union can take disciplinary action against LSESU staff or a student group (such as a club or society). For the avoidance of doubt, the Students’ Union procedure is separate to the School procedures and information would not normally be shared between the LSESU and the School unless the student has consented or if there are exceptional circumstances that require the sharing of that information (i.e. safeguarding issues). 11 For members of staff: • Grievance Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff (most cases would initially begin under this procedure) : https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies- and- procedures/Assets/Documents/griPolProAcaSupSta.pdf • Disciplinary and Dismissal Policy for Professional Services Staff: https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human- Resources/Assets/Internal/staff/Policy/PSSDisAndDismissal.pdf • Academic Annex Procedure for Academic and Research staff: https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies- and-procedures/Assets/Documents/acaAnn.pdf 6.5 Allegations by or against other members of the LSE community will be considered under their relevant contract/engagement with the School or any other relevant School Procedure/ Policy/ Code which may relate specifically to them. 6.6 Disclosures/Reports regarding discrimination, harassment and bullying may also be made using the School’s Report It Stop It tool. Reports raised through this tool may subsequently be investigate d under one of the above set out procedures. 6.7 If an individual has experienced or witnessed third party harassment (of a member of the LSE Community) they should initially discuss this with t heir line manager, supervisor, a cademic mentor, Senior School Advocate for Students or one of the Internal contacts set out in Appendix 2 in the first instance. The School will then consider what appropriate action will need to be taken which may include but is not limited to notifying third parties and using their complaints procedure if applicable or notifying LS E Security and/or the police if required. 6.8 Where a disclosure or report indicates that there may be a risk of harm to that individual or others within the LSE Community, then a small, select few members of the School which may include a representative from Student Services, the Legal team, Human Resources, Security, Residences and the Disability and Wellbeing Service aside from the Chair (‘the Group’) will meet ‘on a need to know basis ’ to assess the risks arising from such disclosure/report and consider what immediate and long term action may be necessary and by who to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the individual who has made the disclosure or report as well as the other students, staff and wider LSE Community who may also be at risk or need assistance. Anyone at the School may trigger this Group or may seek confidential advice from any member of the Group who will provide guidance as to whether the Group should be triggered or whether the matter may be referred to a specific area of the School. 6.9 Cluster disclosures Where there may be a cluster of disclosures (whether made anonymously or not) that originate from a specific Department/Division of the School and which concern any type of unacceptable behaviour outlined in this Policy, then the School may carry out an investigation /survey with staff/students, where relevant, within the specific Department/Division. This is to ascertain information on and understand the unacceptable behaviour that has been disclosed and to identify next steps including putting in place appropriate support and/or taking any necessary preventative measures. 6.10 Malicious and/or vexatious allegations 12 Disciplinary action may be taken if allegations are found to be malicious or vexatious. However, individuals will not be subject to disciplinary action or to any other detriment simply because their complaint is not upheld, and will only face disciplinary action if it is found both that the allegation is false and made in bad faith (that is, without an honest belief in its truth ). 7. Confidentiality and Data Protection 7.1 The School will conduct confidential and impartial investigations into all egations made relating to unacceptable behaviour or conduct as outlined in this Policy. It will at all times comply with The Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Any information provided in relation to harassment, discrimination and/or bullying shall be kept confidential and will only be shared with others within the School on a ‘need to know’ basis. 7.2 T here may be instances where the School may have to disclose confidential information to the police (where in exceptional circumstances the School considers that there is a high risk of continuing harm to the reporting individual or others within the LSE community or to prevent a further incident which constitutes a criminal offence from occurring), the civil and criminal courts if requested formally or to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). The School may also use anonymous data on ca ses internally for reporting, learning, training and evaluating or externally with regulators in the higher education sector. 8. Monitoring of Cases 8.1 The School will compile anonymous information about the number, nature and outcomes of, discrimination, harassment and bullying cases each academic year, with a view to keeping the Ethics Management Board, the Harassment and Safeguarding Forum and the HR Management Board updated. The Policy will also be reviewed at regular intervals to monitor its effectiveness. *Please note that this policy can be available in other formats if required. 13 APPENDIX 1 - EXAMPLES This Appendix provides some examples. DISCRIMINATION Direct Discrimination Age: • An employer refuses an individual to do a training course because they think they are ‘too old’, but allows younger colleagues to do the training. Disability : • during an interview, a job applicant tells the potential employer that he has multiple sclerosis. The employer decides not to appoint the individual even though they are the best candidate they have interviewed, because they assume the individual will need a lot of time off sick Gender re -assignment: • a transsexual (as defined under the Equality Act 2010) student is discriminated against and treated differently t o someone who is non transsexual Marriage : • a woman works night shifts but is dismissed when she gets married because her employer thinks a married woman should be at home in the evening Race: • a member of staff or student is treated less favourably than their colleague or peer and denied promotion (in relation to a member of staff) because they are from a different race Sex: • male students are given preferential treatment in seminars over female students • Devaluing women, their voices and their work. This can include explaining things to women in a condescending way as if they have no knowledge on the subject, talking over women or talking down on the work of a woman within a field/subject. This can also in clude having different views or judgments on behaviour, for example, women in leadership may be called bossy and seen negatively whereas men may be congratulated and are given more positive connotations in comparison; • Silencing, belittling or stereotyping women; this can include but is not limited to not including women in conversations, and making assumptions about a particular role being suitable for specific genders. An example can include organising a course committee meeting and women being expected to organise the refreshments. Sexual orientation : • at a job interview, a woman makes a reference to her girlfriend. The employer decides not to offer her the job, even though she is the best candidate they have interviewed Examples of direct discrimination based on association or perception: • an individual is discriminated against because their family member is transgender (association) 14 • an individual is discriminated against because they are perceived to be of a certain religion (perception) Indirect Discrimination Age: • an employer applies a policy whereby it only offers training development opportunities to employees under the age of 30. Disability : • a job advert states that all applicants must have a driving licence. This puts some disabled people at a disadvantage because they may not have a licence because, for example, they have epilepsy. If the re is an occupational requirement for this, the requirement will be justified. I f it is for a class teacher it would be more difficult to justify. Gender re -assignment: • a class teacher runs an ice-breaker asking all students to bring in childhood photos and then chastises a trans student for not doing so (because the student does not want their colleagues to know that their natal sex doesn’t align with their gender identity ). Race : • An employer refuses to employ people who cover their own hair, this would put certain individuals from a particular race (s) at a disadvantage when applying for a position Religion : • a dress code is imposed which in appearance applies to everyone, but which may discriminate against certain individuals w ho follow a particular religion Sex: • an imposition of compulsory full time work for all is introduced per new criteria – this may put female staff members at a disadvantage as they are more likely to be the primary care giver for their children and may need to work part time/have flexible hours Sexual Orientation : • There is a Policy which is in place which prevents students who are LGBT Q from taking part in an organised field trip. Discrimination arising out of a disability • A student with autism who can be disruptive is asked not to no longer attend seminars and lectures 15 • A department is aware that a new member of staff requires certain reasonable adjustments to be made as a result of their disability. Some of those adjustments are made, but other adjustments are not made which results in the staff member struggling at work and requiring further time off. • an employee with cancer is prevented from receiving a bonus because of time they have taken time off to receive treatment HARASSMENT • jokes, offensive remarks or intimate questions conveyed orally or in writing directly to a person or about a person to a third party ; • producing, sending or displaying inappropriate and/or offensive images or other material to, or about, a person or group ; • insulting, abusive, embarrassing or patronising behaviour or comments, humiliating and/or demeaning criticism ; • abuse, threats or intimidation towards a person or group ; • damaging, defacing or removing a person’s or group’s property ; • breaching a person’s confidentiality by disclosing their sensitive personal information ; • less favourable treatment by excluding a person from a benefit or opportunity that is open to others ; • isolation from normal work or study place conversations or social events ; • unwanted physical conduct such touching, staring at or hitting a person; • sexually assaulting or making sexual advances towards another person; • being part and contributing to a workplace or study environment where a culture which tolerates harassment and bullying persists, i.e. in telling racist/religious jokes; • persistently overloading an individual with work that the individual cannot reasonably be expected to complete; • Gaslighting -manipulative, abusive behaviour targeting an individual with the purpose of making them question their own memory, perception or judgment using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction and lying. Harassment due to age This could be any action whereby prejudicial assumptions, attitudes and stereotyping is expressed about an individual’s abilities based on their age. It can also result in exclusions from social or educational activities as a result of these prejudicial vi ews. • assumptions regarding the individual's inability to learn • offensive remarks • exclusion on the basis of age Harassment of people with disabilities This could include any of the following: 16 • failure to make reasonable adjustments • imposing unfair work expectations and tasks • intimidation and name calling • discussion of the effects of a disability on an individual’s personal life • inappropriate touching or staring relating to an individual’s disability • inappropriate questions about the impact of someone’s disability Harassment due to gender re -assignment Gender re- assignment covers a person who: • is proposing to undergo • is undergoing • or has undergone a process, or part of the process, to reassign their sex by changing physiological or other attributes determining sex.

This can include explaining things to women in a condescending way as if they have no knowledge on the subject, talking over women or talking down on the work of a woman within a field/subject. This can also in clude having different views or judgments on behaviour, for example, women in leadership may be called bossy and seen negatively whereas men may be congratulated and are given more positive connotations in comparison; • Silencing, belittling or stereotyping women; this can includ e but is not limited to not including women in conversations, and making assumptions about a particular role being suitable for specific genders. An example can include organising a course committee meeting and women being expected to organise the refreshments Harassment based on Sexual Orientation 18 Homophobia is a term used to describe a range of negative attitudes and feelings towards homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT).

The School recognises sexual harassment and sexual violence are prevalent in all areas of society, including higher educa tion, and can take many forms. The nature of sexual harassment can be difficult to recognise and, gone undetected, can result in a culture that tolerates such behaviour. This can lead to individuals feeling isolated and unsafe. LSE recognises the import ance of raising specific awareness of sexual harassment and sexual violence to promote a fully inclusive culture in order to enable issues to be tackled appropriately if they occur, resulting in a better environment for all. The School’s Ethics Code includes Equality of Respect and Opportunity as one of the Code’s six key principles. This details the School’s commitment to treating all people with dignity and respect and ensuring that no person is treated less favourably as a result of any of the pro tected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010, including gender (and gender identity). Policy Aims This policy explains the steps LSE will take to provide a safe environment free from sexual harassment and violence. LSE recognises the need to chal lenge any tacit or explicit acceptance of sexual harassment or sexual violence to prevent escalation. LSE also undertakes to improve the understanding of sexual harassment across the School’s community to prevent it occurring, as well as providing a suppo rtive culture, which encourages reporting of incidents and ensures that they are dealt with sensitively and appropriately. It is recognised that it can be distressing for all those affected by a sexual harassment disclosure; this policy aims to ensure tha t all parties are treated with dignity and respect and provided with appropriate support. Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Policy Operational 2 In addition to addressing individual complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence, LSE will take steps to understand the nature and extent of sexual harassment and sexual violence experienced by members of the LSE community on its premises that goes unreported. Scope of Policy LSE recognises that all people, including men in heterosexual and same gender relationships and transgender and non -binary people, can experience sexual harassment and/or sexual violence. This policy applies to all members of the LSE community regardless of gender or sexuality. The School will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment or sexual violence within its community or against its members. This may go beyond the physical premises and normal business hours of the School, such as conduct at events and trips abroad or on social media. This policy applies to the LSE community and specifically relates to sexual harassm ent or sexual violence perpetrated by: • a student against a student, member of staff or lay governor; • a member of staff against a student, member of staff or lay governor; and • a lay governor against a student, member of staff or lay governor. The Schoo l also commits to tackling sexual harassment or sexual violence by, or against, any other party who is contracted to abide by this policy, such as visiting fellows, and will take action deemed appropriate in the circumstances. Whilst issues relating to s exual harassment and/or sexual violence may arise as a result of a power differential, they are not necessarily confined to the behaviour of any particular group of staff to another, e.g. senior staff towards more junior staff, or, indeed, staff towards st udents. It can take place between persons at the same level or involve staff or students behaving inappropriately towards more senior members of the School. Definitions For the purposes of this Policy, the following definitions apply: Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual’s dignity; making an individual feel intimidated, degraded or humiliated and/or creating a hostile or offensive environment. Sexual harassment also occurs if an individual treats a person less favourably because that person has rejected or submitted to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature or that is related to gender identity or sex, and which has had the purpose or effect described in this section. In this scenario, the person who treats someone less favourably might not be the person who engaged in the unwanted conduct. 3 Sexual violence is any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act by violence or coercion which takes place without consent. Actions or behaviour which may constitute sexual harassment or sexual violence include, but are not limited to, the following: sexual comments or jokes, touching, sexual assault including groping, unwelcome sexual advances, displaying or showing material of a pornographic or sexual nature, making requests for sexual favours, stalking in person or online, rape. Online harassment may take the for m of intimidating, offensive, or graphic posts on social media sites or chat rooms, or sexually explicit communications by email, text, or instant messaging. Consent is providing permission for something to happen or agreement to do something with a full understanding of the facts and without coercion. In cases of sexual activity, consent cannot be presumed but must be explicitly given, verbally or non -verbally. Consent cannot be deemed to have been given if it is provided under pressure or in situations w here someone is not capable of providing it. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. LSE community includes all salaried and non -salaried members of staff, students and lay governors of the School. The School will take steps to ensure other relevant partie s comply with the required standards of behaviour in this policy by way of contract. Safe Contacts are members of LSE staff who have received advanced anti -sexual violence and harassment training and can provide a primary point of contact, information an d support for individuals disclosing sexual violence or sexual harassment. Policy Principles Preventing Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence LSE will take steps to eliminate sexual harassment and sexual violence and other unlawful discrimination. The School will actively promote equality in order to provide a collegiate, lawful and harmonious working and learning environment. LSE will endeav our to raise awareness of sexual harassment and sexual violence among staff and students, in conjunction with the LSE Students’ Union. This will be achieved by providing workshops covering the issue of consent for staff and students. Updated contact de tails for ‘Safe Contacts’ will be published annually on the LSE website and in relevant student and staff handbooks. There will be an ongoing programme of training for new and existing Safe Contacts. Neither students nor staff are restricted to making dis closures to these members of staff and the School commits to carrying out briefings to raise awareness and support staff and students who are affected by a disclosure. Reporting Sexual Harassment and/or Sexual Violence 4 LSE provides guidance for students and staff on how to report sexual harassment or sexual violence and the support that is available both internally and externally. This guidance will be updated annually and can be found at https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/equity -diversity -and-inclusion/EDI -and- you/Making -a-choice/Sources -of-support LSE provides detailed guidance for staff on how to handle disclosures of sexual harassment or sexual violence and this guid ance will be updated annually. This guidance can be found at https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/equity -diversity -and- inclusion/Assets/Documents/PDFs/Internal/LSE -staff -guide -to-handling -cases -of-student -sexual - violence -harassment -and-abuse.pdf. LSE will listen to, and take seriously, all disclosures of sexual harassment and sexual violence without making any judgements regarding the circumstances. The School will work with staff and students to provide them with information about their options and the support available to them, both internally within LSE and, where appropriate, externally to statutory services. LSE will respect the sensitivity of complaints of sexual harassment or sexual violence, and their consequences, and will treat any complaint with the utmost confidentiality and in line with the wishes of the individual. Unless there is a safeguarding risk, complaints will not normally be taken further than the complainant wishes, thereby allowing for both informal and formal resolution. All those affected by the disclosure, including the person accused and the person to whom the disclosure was made, may access support through the School’s counselling services and the LSESU Advice Service. Action against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence The School will conduct confidential and impartial investigations in response to allegations of sexual harassment and/or sexual violence made against students or staff as appropriate under the School’s relevant staff or student procedure (see Related Policies and Procedures section below). Where historical allegations are brought by a member of the LSE community, including alumni, these will be taken seriously and, where possible, reasonable a ttempts will be made to obtain relevant information to determine the appropriate response. Investigations will at all times comply with the General Data Protection Regulation 2018. Where an allegation of sexual harassment and/or sexual violence is upheld, this will normally result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion in more serious cases. Disciplinary action may also be taken if allegations of sexual harassment or sexual violence are found to be malicious or vexatious. Where appropriate, following an allegation of sexual harassment and/or sexual violence, the School may be required, or decide, to take steps in relation to the alleged perpetrator, in order to prevent contact between the two parties pending the conclusion of th e ongoing investigation(s). Actions taken will be proportionate and will constitute a neutral act. Such actions may include a change in accommodation or working location or suspension. Where it is considered that it may be necessary, suspension will be carried out in line with the relevant disciplinary procedure. 5 The School and the LSE Students’ Union may also use their own separate procedures to investigate and take appropriate action to resolve the same allegation of sexual harassment or sexual vi olence (i.e. the School considering a student’s status at LSE, the Union considering a student’s membership of its organisation). In cases of staff/student incidents, the School and the LSE Students’ Union will keep each other informed of relevant action where appropriate. The School will also take appropriate steps to deal with behaviour, intentional or unintentional, that results in a breach of this policy. It should be noted that a member of the LSE community is personally liable for their actions, w hich in some instances could lead to criminal or civil action in the Courts under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, Equality Act 2010 or other relevant legislation, such as the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Where a complaint is being investigated a s a criminal act, the School the School will normally defer its own internal investigations pending the conclusion of the criminal case. However, where appropriate, the School reserves the right to conclude its own investigations regardless of the crimina l proceedings and without delay. In these cases, caution will be exercised to prevent any internal investigations from compromising the criminal proceedings. Internal investigations will be judged on the balance of probability, as opposed to the criminal standard of ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. As such, it is possible that different conclusions may be reached in the separate proceedings. Monitoring sexual harassment or sexual violence within the LSE community LSE will record and compile anonymous infor mation about the number, nature and outcome of reported sexual harassment or sexual violence incidents and investigations and the time it took to reach resolution each year. The Safeguarding group will be responsible for carrying out the monitoring and wi ll report into the EDI Advisory board. Legislation The Equality Act 2010 applies to nine protected characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. It provides individuals with legal protection against harassment. The School also has a Public Sector Equality Duty, and therefore has a general duty to have due regard to eliminating harassment The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) : underpins all equality legislation that relates to employers in the public sector, and those for whom they provide services. Article 3, in particular, includes serious physical assault, defining it as inhuman treatment. Article 8 sets out your right to control who sees and touches your body. The General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) sets out six legal principles for the processing of data and rules around consent. It ensures that personal data must be secured in line with the Regulation and provides right of access to that data, It does not cover cases of lawful interception 6 and indiv iduals should note that it may be necessary to provide data to the police if required to do so during a criminal investigation. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 prohibits harassment whatever the cause, with Section 2A specifically referring to s talking. The Act gives both civil and criminal remedies. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 covers all physical forms of sexual abuse, specifically non -consensual sexual activity. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 contains specific provision relating to sex offe nders. It can impose a Sex Offender Order on an individual for up to five years to protect the public from harm 7 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 1 year 15/10/19 15/08/19 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 17/05/2018 Safeguarding Group 2 07/06/2018 JNICC 3 19/06/2018 SMC Links Reference Link Ethics Code https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/ethCod.pdf LSE Policy on P ersonal Relationships https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/perRelPolAndPro.p df Effective Behaviours Framework https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human - Resources/Assets/Internal/staff/OL/Effective - Behaviours -Framework.pdf Code of R esidences Conduct http://www.lse.ac.uk/student - life/accommodation/assets/documents/code -of- conduct.pdf Guidance on Reporting Bullying and Harassment https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/equity - diversity -and-inclusion/EDI -and-you/Making -a- choice/Sources -of-support Guidance for S taff on how to Handle D isclosures of S exual Harassment or S exual V iolence https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/equity - diversity -and- inclusion/Assets/Documents/PDFs/Internal/LSE - staff -guide -to-handling -cases -of-student -sexual - violence -harassment -and-abuse.pdf Procedure for Considering Allegations of Harassment from Students Against Members of Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/Services/Polici es-and- procedures/Assets/Documents/proHarStu.pdf?fro m_serp=1 Grievance Policy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff https://info.lse. ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/griPolProAcaSupSt a.pdf Academic Annex https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/acaAnn.pdf 8 Disciplinary Procedure for Students https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/disProStu.pdf Disciplinary and Dismissal Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/Human - Resources/Assets/Internal/staff/Policy/PSSDisAnd Dismissal.pdf Exceptional Circumstances Guidance https://info.lse.ac.uk/current - students/services/assessment -and- results/exceptional -circumstances/exceptional - circumst ances Contacts Position Name Email Notes HR Policy Lisa Morrow l.morrow@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE works towards positively supporting employees who are working parents and has attained a reputation as a top university for working families. The School is committed to developing work policies and practices that support the work -life balance of employ ees. As part of this commitment, paternity /partner’s leave and pay is available to all eligible employees within the diverse School community, including LGBT Q+, same -sex families and those involved in a surrogacy arrangement. 1.2. This policy uses the following key terms: • Birth parent / mother : the individual who gives birth to a child. They can be male, female or of a non -binary identity. • Partner : the child’s biological father or the partner of the birth parent / mother / adopter. This can be a spouse, civil partner, or a partner who is living in an enduring relationship with the birth parent / mother and the child. Partners may be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non -binary identity). • Adopter : the person who is eligible for adoption leave and/or pay. Adopters may be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non -binary identity). 2. Policy aims 2.1. The School seeks to sustain a strong track record as a diverse, fair and flexible employer that attracts and retains high calibre talent and supports the career progression of the School’s diverse community during their employment. In keeping with that aim, this policy outlines the School’s provision in respect of paternity /partner’s leave and pay, as well as offering flexibility in how employees choose to manage their work and personal commitments during, and following, such periods of leave. Paternity /Partner’s Leave P olicy Operational 2 3. Policy scope 3.1. This policy applies to all LSE em ployees of all grades who meet the eligibility criteria set out below. Access to contractual paternity/partner’s leave and pay applies regardless of length of service, i.e., an employee may take such leave from their first day of employment with LSE. 4. Policy principles 4.1. As part of LSE’s commitment to support working parents and improved work -life balance, all qualifying employees can access contractual paternity/partner’s leave, which is paid for up to four weeks and applies regardless of length of serv ice. 4.2. This policy and procedure outline entitlements to contractual paternity rights. Any employee who wish es to apply for paternity /partner’s leave and pay may also contact their HR Adviser for more specific advice. 4.3. The policy and procedure also set out the additional provisions and entitlements for partners whose baby is born prematurely and requires neonatal care. 5. Eligibility for Occupational Paternity/Partner’s Leave and Pay (OPL/OPP ) 5.1. Employees who qualify for Occupational Paternity/Partner’s Leave (OPL) are eligible to take up to four weeks’ leave which is paid at full pay (pro -rata for less than full -time employment) 1, regardless of their length of service. 5.2. This is inclusive of Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) 2 (the rates can be found on: www.gov.uk/paternity -pay-leave/pay). 5.3. To qualify for contractual paid paternity/partner’s leave, the employee must be: a. the child’s biological father ; or the partner of the birth parent/adopter (i.e., a spouse, civil partner, or a partner who is living in an enduring relationship with the birth parent/mother and the child ), and b. employed at the School on the date the child is b orn/adopted, and 1 For hourly paid staff, this is calculated on the ba sis of the average of previous working hours up to a maximum of twelve months. 2 To qualify for statutory paternity pay (SPP), employees must be employed up to the date the child is born ( (or placed with the adopter) (paternity pay only) ), have at least 26 weeks continuous service at the Notification Week (15th week before the expected week of childbirth) or 26 weeks up to any da y in the week they were matched with a child (UK adoptions) or 26 weeks by either the date the child arrives in the UK or when they want their pay to start (overseas adoptions), and with average weekly earnings above the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions 3 c. responsible for the child’s upbringing. 5.4. To be fully eligible, staff must follow the procedure set out below. 5.5. Paternity/partner’s leave can be taken before and around the time of childbirth (or the date of placement/the date of the child’s arrival in the UK, in case of adoption) or within a reasonable time period afterwards up to eight weeks after the child is born (or after the date of placement/the date of the child’s arrival in the UK, in case of adoption). If there are pregnancy complications, additional time off can be given, on a compassionate basis, for attendance at antenatal appointments. 5.6. Employees can expect to take the full entitlement in blocks of one or more weeks. If it is intended to take the leave as one or more block s of two to four weeks, employees are encouraged to give the manager as much notice as possible to allow for appropriate planning to cover for the absence. 6. Stillbirth a nd Miscarriages 6.1. LSE will support employees throughout the practical implementation of this policy, including in the sad event of a miscarriage or stillbirth. For the purposes of this policy, a miscarriage is when a baby is born dead before the 24th week o f pregnancy; a stillbirth is when the baby is born dead after the beginning of the 24th week of pregnancy. In such cases, individuals may wish to seek support from the Staff Counselling Service or the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP). 6.2. In the event of a stillbirth, the partner can still apply for and take paternity /partner’s leave (and pay) under this policy. This leave must be completed within the period from the actual date or birth to 56 days after the expected week of childbirth. 6.3. In the event of a miscarriage, the partner is not entitled to take paternity /partner’s leave. The employee) is encouraged to discuss options with their line manager and/or HR, where relevant, to help them manage the situation. This may include taking appropriate time for their wellbeing, e.g., through a period of sickness absence and/or compassionate leave. 7. Neonatal Leave and Pay 7.1. In the case of premature birth3, in addition to the paternity/partner’s leave provisions set out in section 5, qualifying employees are entitled to an additional period of leave paid at full pay (pro -rata for less than full -time employment). 3 Including extremely pre -term (under 28 weeks), very pre -term (28 -31 weeks) and moderate pre -term (32 -36 weeks). 4 7.2. An employee whose baby is born prematurely is entitled to neonatal leave for every week (i.e., seven calendar days) that their baby is in neonatal care prior to the Expected Week of Childbirth ( for a minimum of one week and up to a maximum of twelve weeks). In such circumstances, paternity/partners’ leave can be taken following the neonatal leave. 7.3. Employees who are eligible to t ake neonatal leave should notify their line manager as soon as possible after the birth of the baby and subsequently confirm how many days their baby was in hospital (neonatal leave notification form ). 5 Paternity /Partner’s Leave Procedure 1. Introduction 1.1. The procedure provides information on the steps that qualifying employees are required to follow to be eligible for Occupational Paternity /Partner’s Leave (OPL). The procedure also includes ways in which employees will be supported prior to and during a period of paternity/partner’s leave. 2. Time off for antenatal care 2.1. Biological f athers and partners of the birth parent/adopter have a statutory right to unpaid time off to attend up to two antenatal appointments. 2.2. The School recognises the importance of a partner being involved with the pregnancy and baby, and therefore offers paid time off to attend up to two antenatal appointments. Employees wishing to accompany their partners to antenatal appointments should speak to their manager and provide as much notice as possible to minimise any operational impact. Any further antenatal appointments that partners wish to attend will be at the manager ’s discretion and subject to operational needs. Managers, depending on the operational requirements, could, for example, adopt a flexible working appr oach whereby a partner makes up any time missed. 2.3. Since 5 April 2015, intended parents in a surrogacy case who meet the conditions set out under the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Act 2008 also have the right to unpaid leave to attend up to two antenat al appointments. Once again, the School recognises the importance of a partner being involved with the pregnancy and baby, and therefore offers paid time off to attend up to two antenatal appointments. 3. Notification requirements 3.1. Prior written notification must be given to Human Resources of the intention to take paternity /partner’s leave, and the likely blocks of time proposed to and agreed by the manager, at least 28 days before it is anticipated that the leave will be taken (Hea ds of Department should seek agreement from the Pro Director Faculty Development ) - paternity/partner’s leave notification form. 3.2. Employees who qualify for statutory paternity leave should also complete the SC3 form and return it to their HR Adviser. Employees should be prepared to send a copy of the respective birth certificate to Human Resources. 3.3. In case of adoption, employees who qualify for statutory paternity leave should complete the SC4 form (or SC5 in case of overseas adoption) and return it to their HR Adviser. Employees should also confirm that their partner is getting Statutory Adoptio n Pay in writing or provide a copy of their partner’s SC6 form. 6 4. Contract of employment 4.1. During paternity /partner’s leave, the employee's contract of employment continues in force, and they are entitled to receive all their contractual benefits. In particular, contractual annual leave entitlement will continue to accrue. 4.2. Pension contributions will continue to be made during any period when the employee is receiving paternity /partner’s leave. Employee and employer contributions will be based on actual pay. 4.3. Employees have the right to r eturn to the job in which they were employed under the original contract of employment and on the same terms and conditions following a period of statutory paternity leave. 5. Contact during paternity /partner’s leave 5.1. The employee should discuss with their line manager arrangements for keeping in touch whilst the employee is on paternity /partner’s leave. The manager has the right to make reasonable contact with the employee whilst they are on paternity /partner’s leave. 6. Returning to work 6.1. Following the end of paternity/partner’s leave, t he employee is expected to return on the next working day unless an additional period of annual leave has been agreed or they notify the School otherwise. 6.2. If the employee is unable to attend work at the end of paternity/partner’s leave due to sickness or injury, the School's normal arrangements, including notification procedures, for sickness absence will apply. 6.3. Failure to return on the due date after the paternity /partner’s leave expires will be regarded as unauthorised absence and may be treated as a disciplinary matter. 6.4. LSE has a range of resources to support disabled staff, including reasonable adjustments and other measures set out in the Disability Policy. In addition to pre -existing disabilities, it is recognised that partners of the birth parent/ado pters may also develop and suffer from mental health conditions relating to paternity (such as postnatal depression or post - adoptive depression) that can in some cases amo unt to a disability. In all situations, staff and managers are encouraged to seek further advice and support as appropriate, which may include their HR Partner, Staff Counselling, or the EAP. 7. Advice 7.1. An employee considering/taking paternity /partner’s leave is encouraged to contact their HR Adviser to discuss their entitlements. 7 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years January 2026 September 2025 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 2 Mar 2015 2 November 2022 JNICC – February 2023 Links Contacts Position Name Email Notes Senior HR Policy Adviser Kieran Darling k.darling@lse.ac.uk HR Policy Adviser Elisabetta Viotto e.viotto@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 Introduction a) The School is committed to creating an environment where staff feel able to raise workplace issues constructively with managers and to have confidence that these will be handled in an appropriate manner. b) Grievances are concerns, problems or complaints at work that may relate to a wide range of workplace issues. The School is committe d to dealing with grievances as speedily as possible, in the most appropriate way depending upon the nature of the grievance, as unresolved concerns and disputes between colleagues can damage working relations and/or cause low morale or ill health. No two grievances are alike; therefore, this policy sets out the principles that will always be applied to ensure a grievance is handled fairly, with the accompanying procedure setting out the framework that should be applied to resolve grievances proportionatel y and as swiftly as is practicable. c) The grievance procedure is not a substitute for good day -to-day communication and employees are encouraged to discuss and resolve daily work place issues. Many problems can be resolved informally if channels of com munication are kept open and work well. Where problems cannot be resolved informally, a grievance may be raised and will be investigated as quickly as possible so that it can be resolved within a reasonable timeframe. d) This Policy and Procedure is applicable to Professional Services members of staff. Grievance Policy and Procedure for Professional Service s Staff Operational 2 Policy Aims e) The principle aim of the School's Grievance Policy and Procedure is to provide a fair process for individual employees to obtain a speedy resolution to problems relating to their employment. This includes problems or concerns about work, management, wor king conditions, working relationships with colleagues, health and safety, new working practices, organisational change and equal opportunities. f) This procedure also applies to investigating cases of alleged bullying, i.e. where an individual feels that they has been subjected to offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, and/or harassment, i.e. unwanted contact that either violates an individual’s dignity or creates a hostile or humiliating environment. The School’s Anti-Bullying and Anti -Harassment Policy should also be referred to in cases where this may be applicable. g) One of the key aims of the policy is to enable the School to provide a working environment in which all employees feel comfortable, able to be themselves, and in which everyone is treated with respect and dignity, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, transgender status, marital or family status, pregnancy, rac e, religion or belief, age, disability or any other personal factor or quality. Scope of Policy h) The main objective in raising a grievance is to resolve the issue that is the basis of the complaint. Employees will – at all stages – be encouraged to consider what successful resolution looks like. The manager handling the grievance will need to understand what an individual is hoping to achieve, e.g. the improvement of a dysfunctional relationship, a promotion d ecision explained, in order to try to reach a resolution of the complaint. i) Informal resolution to workplace grievances will be strongly encouraged in the majority of instances, other than the most serious cases, or instances where informal attempts have failed to yield a satisfactory outcome. Informal resolution may involve formal mediation, or may simply involve a matter being raised with a manager who goes on to deal with the issue, or a manager and/or HR Partner assisting two or more colleagues to re solve a difficulty or misunderstanding. Formal procedures will always be available to staff covered by this policy, but it will be usual to be expected to explore informal means of resolving problems first. j) Equally, early resolution normally leads to b etter success than allowing issues to fester. It is also difficult for managers to investigate issues that happened a long time ago. As such, staff are 3 expected to use informal and/or formal means in a timely manner that both allows issues to be ‘nipped in the bud’ where this is possible, but also allows managers to meaningfully tackle the issue being raised. k) Grievances – whether at informal or formal stage – will normally be raised with an individual’s line manager. Where the grievance is about the l ine manager, the next most senior manager should be approached. l) Employees have the right to be accompanied at formal grievance meetings by a work colleague or a trade union representative. m) The School requires employees responsible for carrying out in vestigations of formal complaints to be trained beforehand or to seek advice and support from a trained colleague (usually within HR). n) Employees not satisfied with the outcome of the formal Grievance Procedure will have the right to appeal the decision under the separate Appeals Procedure for Academic Support Staff. o) The principles of the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures are embedded in this policy and procedure and will be followed in all cases to ensure that a fair process has been followed. 4 Grievance Procedure 1. Roles and Responsibilities a) This procedure applies to Professional Services staff only. b) The investigator may be the line manager, or a person nominated by the line manager to carry out the investigation. If the line manager is the subject of the grievance then the investigator may be the line manager’s manager, or anot her manager who they choose to nominate. Where the investigator is a nominee outside of the line management chain, advice will be sought from the HR Division on the selection of an appropriate alternative. c) Employees have a responsibility to: \\uf0a7 Raise a gr ievance with their manager within a reasonable amount of time; \\uf0a7 Clearly state the basis of their grievance and provide the manager with all relevant details; \\uf0a7 Where possible, attempt to deal with the grievance informally before resorting to the formal stag es of the procedure; \\uf0a7 Indicate what would be a satisfactory outcome to their grievance; \\uf0a7 Attend meetings held under the grievance procedure and participant constructively in the grievance process. Failure to comply with these responsibilities could preven t the School from offering support it might otherwise be able to provide. d) Managers have a responsibility to: \\uf0a7 Deal with grievances promptly, fairly and consistently in accordance with the relevant policy and procedure; \\uf0a7 Seek advice from a trained member of the HR Division, e.g. an HR Partner; \\uf0a7 Clearly explain the reasons behind any decision made in respect of a grievance; e) Grievances are normally raised by an individual but may, on occasion, be raised by a group of individuals. This procedure is constr ucted with individual grievances in mind, but may be modified as appropriate where group concerns are raised. Where this is the case, the manager with whom the grievance is raised will seek advice from an HR Partner and discuss with the aggrieved group the best way of handling the complaint. 5 2. Exclusions a) This procedure relates to all individual grievances concerning matters for which there are no separate agreed procedures. As such, it does not apply to: \\uf0a7 collective disputes, i.e. matters raised by t he Trade Unions affecting two or more employees that that should be dealt with under the School’s recognition and procedural agreement; \\uf0a7 matters which fall within the remit of the Public Interest Disclosure Procedure. b) The grievance procedure cannot be u sed to challenge formal outcomes in other procedures which have an identified appeals process, i.e.: \\uf0a7 Disciplinary and Dismissals Policy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff, \\uf0a7 Capability – Performance P olicy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff, \\uf0a7 Capability - Health Policy and Procedure for Academic Support Staff, \\uf0a7 Redundancy Procedure for Academic Support Staff, \\uf0a7 Review Period Procedures, \\uf0a7 Cases that fall under the School’s Professional Services Regrading Policy c) Where paragraph 2(b) above does not apply, a grievance raised by an employee subject to one or more of the above procedures will be dealt with in the normal way and in parallel with the other procedure. The School may also choose to suspend an associa ted procedure for a short period, while the grievance is considered. d) This procedure does not apply to grievances initiated after the end of employment and the procedure may be modified for grievances submitted during an employee’s notice period. 3. Inf ormal Resolution a) In the majority of instances, staff are expected to raise grievances informally before proceeding to a formal grievance. Handling a grievance informally does not mean that the responsibility to resolving the concern rests with the ind ividual; rather, the expectation is that they will raise the concern with an appropriate manager and will be open to a discussion about trying to resolve the grievance informally. In some circumstances an individual may feel able to resolve a problem thems elves, e.g. giving feedback to a colleague about an action that caused the individual distress, but on other occasions a manager or an HR Partner may be able to help facilitate a solution. In many instances, grievances arise from misunderstandings or poor communication that can be easily remedied. 6 b) Where grievances are resolved at the informal stage, it is advisable for managers to confirm in writing (e.g. by email) with the employee the informal action taken and to double check that the matter is in fac t concluded. This allows both the individual and manager to have confidence that the matter is dealt with and that actions agreed to will be followed though. It is not always possible to recognise an informal grievance when one is raised (managers should be dealing with staff concerns as they arise as a matter of routine), in which case, it is likely that the matter is simply dealt though normal supervisory channels. Mediation c) In many cases, mediation can help to resolve workplaces difficulties involving two or more people. Mediation is a voluntary process that involves the appointment of a third -party mediator, who will discuss the issues raised by the employee’s grievance with all those involved and seek to facilitate a resolution for agreement by the parties. Mediation should be discussed as an option during the informal stage of grievance resolution, but can also be suggested at any point of a formal grievance process, in addition to being a reasonable recommendation following a formal grievance decision. d) For mediation to be successful, both parties need to be happy to participate in the process. Mediation referrals can be made via the HR Partners, who can also expla in to any involved party what a mediation process would entail before they commit to proceeding with mediation. e) Agreement to mediation does not preclude the employee from either withdrawing from the process at a later stage, or submitting a formal gri evance either in parallel or subsequently if the mediation is unsuccessful (bearing in mind the responsibility to raise the grievance within a reasonable amount of time). f) Where mediation is not necessary, or is not the right option in the circumstances, managers should consider broadly and creatively what may help to resolve the situation at hand. In some cases, an apology or acknowledgement from one party to the other is enough to resolve a grievance. Advice may always be sought from an HR Partner in bringing an informal grievance to a successful conclusion. 4. Formal Grievance Procedure i) Setting out the grievance a) If informal attempts to resolve the grievance do not adequately resolve the matter, or are considered inappropriate in the circumstan ces, the employee should progress to a formal grievance 7 by setting out their concerns in writing using the Statement of Grievance Form (Appendix 1) and submitting it to the relevant HR Partner with any relevant documentation. Further particulars may be requested of the employee where the specifics of the complaint are not clear. HR Partners may also suggest that appropriate informal attempts to resolve the grievance are made, where it is not evident that this has already happened. b) Reports of bullying and harassment received by the HR Partner Team via the online reporting tool will not be assumed to be formal grievances until an HR Partner has contacted the individual and discussed the nature of their complaint and/or concerns. Should the individual wish to try an informal route to resolution first, the HR Partner will provide appropriate advice in line with this procedure. This would not preclude the individual from subsequently utilising the formal grievance procedure. However, should the individual wi sh to pursue this as a formal grievance, the HR Partner will liaise with the individual to gather any additional necessary information normally available through the Statement of Grievance Form. ii) Investigating the Grievance a) On receiving a Statemen t of Grievance Form, the HR Partner shall contact either the line manager or the line manager’s manager, depending upon the subject of the grievance. The manager will determine whether they will handle the grievance themselves, or whether it is appropriat e to nominate another manager to investigate the grievance. b) The decision to nominate an alternative investigator may be based on a number of factors – some practical, e.g. availability, and some depending upon the nature of the grievance, e.g. where professional expertise from elsewhere in the School may be of additional value (e.g. if financial regulations are a factor in the case). Awareness of the circumstances of the case or familiarity with the individual raising the grievance shall not preclude an investigator from dealing with the grievance, unless the grievance specifically implicates the proposed investigator. It is incumbent upon those asked to investigate that they declare any potential conflict of interest and/or personal involvement with t he case in order for the manager to determine whether another investigator should be approached. c) The individual shall normally be notified of the name of the investigator and the date for the initial meeting within five working days of the submission of the Statement of Grievance Form. Wherever possible, the meeting will be held within ten working days of the submission of the grievance. Where this is not possible, the individual will be informed of the reason for the delay. Where the individual raisi ng the grievance believes there is a conflict of interest with the chosen investigator, they should 8 raise this with their manager or line manager’s manager, as appropriate. The manager will give due consideration to the concern raised, though may ultimate ly conclude that there is no conflict of interest and instruct the investigation to proceed as planned. d) At the grievance meeting, the individual shall be given the opportunity of explaining their grievance, submitting any witness statements if appropria te, and invited to explore ways in which the issue(s) may be resolved. The investigator will ask any necessary questions in order to fully understand the grievance. e) A member of HR will normally be present with the investigator to provide procedural advice, and they may also ask questions for clarification. A second member of the HR Division may also be present to prepare a written record of the meeting. f) At th e end of the meeting, the investigator should provide an estimate of the timescale of the remainder of the investigation, taking into consideration whether it is likely that many other people will need to be interviewed. The investigator should agree to k eep the individual informed on a regular basis if the investigation takes longer than initially envisaged. g) In the case of an allegation of bullying or harassment, where the investigator has good cause to believe that there is a risk of further bullying or harassment they will inform the relevant Head of Department or Service (or their manager if they are the perpetrator) and require them to take interim steps, without prejudice to the eventual findings, to prevent any recurrence. Where the grievance arises from a change of work role or substantive workplace practices, the way things were before shall prevail until the investigator has determined the outcome of the grievance. h) Where there is an individual ‘subject’ of the grievance, the investigator wil l forward a copy of the completed Statement of Grievance Form and any relevant supporting documentation to the subject of a grievance and invite the person to a meeting. Where the grievance has multiple strands that may involve different people, the invest igator may choose to only send extracts of the Statement of Grievance Form to relevant staff to be interviewed; this judgement lies with the investigator and will be made by balancing what best serves the aim of resolving the grievance against the right of individuals to defend themselves against accusations that have been made. i) A work colleague or trade union representative may accompany the individual who has submitted the grievance as well as any subject(s) of the grievance at meetings. See Section 7 of this procedure for more information about the role of the companion. j) It will be usual for a note -taker to be present at investigatory meetings (usually from HR) and records 9 of all meetings shall be prepared and sent to each individual, normally with in five working days. Employees will be asked to confirm that the written notes are a true and accurate of the meeting. k) Follow up meetings, e.g. where new information comes to light from a subsequent witness which requires a renewed conversation with either the individual, the subject of the grievance or another witness, are permissible and the same principles regarding the right to be accompanied will apply (see Section 7). Alternatively, the investigator may choose to ask any follow up clarification s by email. l) Should the individual wish to request that the outcome of the grievance investigation, including a summary of the findings, be confirmed in a meeting, they can request this either at their initial investigation meeting or as soon as is reasonably practi cable during the investigation. However, requests for such a meeting will not be met once the outcome of the grievance has been provided to the individual. m) The HR Partner responsible for the grievance shall monitor the progress of the grievance. The partner shall inform the HR Director of any grievance not resolved within 90 days of the submission of the grievance. If the HR Director believes there to have been undue delay they shall raise the issue with the relevant Head of Department/Service to prom ote a speedy conclusion. iii) Concluding the Grievance a) Once the investigator has gathered and considered relevant evidence, they should compile an investigatory report. The scale of the investigation report is likely to be directly proportionate to the scope and seriousness of the grievance. The report should summarise the key issues, document the evidence received, evaluate the key evidence considered and clearly outline the conclusions drawn. This should include a decision whether to uphold or rejec t all or part of the individual’s grievance. b) The outcome of the grievance will be confirmed to the individual in writing in good time following conclusion of the investigation. The letter will provide a summary of the investigation, the investigator’s k ey conclusions and decisions on whether the grievance is upheld or rejected in full or in part. c) Where the investigator is not the line manager of the individual, they shall inform the line manager (or the line manager’s manager dependent on who instruct ed the investigation) of any relevant issues arising from the outcome of the grievance that need addressing in order to ensure effective management of the issues in the future, including a copy of the full investigation report. 1 0 d) The subject of a grievan ce shall be informed of the outcome and may request that this is confirmed in writing. They will not receive a copy of the full written outcome sent to the individual. iv) Possible Outcomes of Grievance Investigations Grievance Upheld a) The investigator should decide what steps and related timescales should be taken to resolve the grievance and/or associated underlying issues. They should either implement the steps themselves or report the necessary actions to the relevant manager wit h authority to implement the steps. b) If the investigator concludes that there has been bullying or harassment they shall report this to the offender’s line manager with a view to instigating appropriate disciplinary proceedings. In the case of bullying and harassment there will be no presumption that the issue will be resolved by moving the person bullied or harassed. If the investigator uncovers other matters that they feel ought to also be subject of disciplinary proceedings, these should also be refer red to the relevant manager. Grievance Not Upheld c) The investigator should report the outcome to the manager responsible for taking action and include in the report any steps that need to be taken to address any underlying issues that have been disclosed as part of the grievance. In many cases, even when a grievance is not upheld the investigation unveils problems or issues that should be resolved in order to improve the working environment, e.g. coaching or training needs. Grievance Partially Upheld d) The investigator should be clear with both the individual and the relevant manager (if they are not the manager themselves) which elements of the grievance are upheld and which are not, alongside any relevant remedies or recommendation actions that are sug gested. 6. Appeals a) Individuals should refer to the separate Appeals Procedure for Academic Support Staff for information about the right to appeal against decisions made in accordance with this procedure. 7. Right of Accompaniment a) The individual and the subject(s) of a grievance shall take all reasonable steps to attend meetings 1 1 held in connection with the grievance and may be accompanied by a work colleague or certified trade union representative. Should the chosen companion be unavailable on the proposed date of the meetings, the individual shall immediately request that the meeting is postponed once to another reasonable date and time that should be within five working days of the given date. Where this is not possible, the ind ividual shall choose an alternative person to accompany them to the meetings. b) If the reason for the individual or companion being unable to attend the meetings is for reasons that were unforeseeable at the time of arranging the meetings, the individual will be notified of a new date, time and location by the investigator dealing with the grievance. c) Should an individual choose to be accompanied, it is their responsibility to notify HR of the name of their companion as well as providing their chosen c ompanion with the date and time of the interview alongside the relevant facts of the case. d) The companion will be able to confer with the individual during grievance meetings and can address the meeting to put forward and sum up the individual’s case, r espond on the individual’s behalf to any view expressed at the hearing and ask questions of clarification. The companion does not, however, have the right to answer questions on the individual’s behalf, address the meeting if the individual does not wish i t or prevent the employer from explaining their case. e) External lawyers by profession, other than those who are employees of a recognised trade union, cannot act as companions under this procedure. 8. Grievances against the Director a) Where the grieva nce is against the Director personally and the matter has not been resolved informally, the individual may submit a Statement of Formal Grievance Form to Council via the School Secretary. The formal grievance will be considered by a panel of three independ ent Lay Governors appointed by the Chair of the Court and Council. Any appeal will be determined by the Chair of the Court and Council and two independent Governors not previously involved in the grievance. 9. Support and Advice a) To ensure consistency of the application of this procedure, managers should seek the advice of an HR Partner before making key decisions. b) Employees submitting or responding to a grievance may seek advice from a work colleague or a trade union repres entative. HR Partners can provide general advice to employees on possible options 1 2 and procedural advice but cannot provide employees with specific advice on taking forward or responding to an individual grievance. c) ACAS also provide a helpline for emplo yees who need advice in dealing with employment issues. The number is 08457 47 47 47 and the website is http://www.acas.org.uk. d) Employees may also find it helpful to seek general support from a School network gro up, for example: EMBRACE (Black and Ethnic Minority Staff Network), SPECTRUM (LGBT+ network), POWER or the Gender Equality Forum (female staff groups). e) The School has a duty of care to all employees who are the victims of bullying or discrimination and will provide support to any employee who believes they are a victim of such behaviour. f) All staff should also be aware that the Staff Counselling Service is available on 020 7955 6953 and at staff.counselling@lse.ac.uk. 1 3 Appendix 1 - Statement of Grievance Form Part 1 - Your Details Your name: Your job title: Your department/division: Date: Part 2 – Your Grievance Does your grievance relate to your line manager?

       "  'text': \" 1 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE has clear expectations of behaviour and conduct from all employees. These expectations are communicated through inductions for new starters (both LSE -wide and local), day to day management processes, and other appropriate means. 1.2. The terms ‘disciplina ry’ and ‘misconduct’ are used interchangeably throughout this policy and procedure; both terms refer to matters related to the disciplinary process. Disciplinary matters cover both situations of misconduct and those issues that arise from an employee’s neg ligence or deliberate unwillingness. 1.3. For the purposes of this policy and procedure, a ‘manager’ is any member of LSE with line management responsibility for one or more professional services staff. 1.4. Where possible, concerns about an employee’s behaviour and/or conduct should be resolved informally and between the employee and their line manager. Where this is not possible or appropriate, this policy provides a formal disciplinary procedure which allows for a number of stages until a matter is resolved. Disciplinary Policy & Procedure for Professional Services staff Operational  2 1.5. In line with LSE’s move to blended ways of working, many staff combine remote and on -campus working. The section 9. Managing disciplinary procedures remotely sets out how formal meetings and hearings under the Disciplinary Procedure may be held when one or more participants is off campus. 2. Aims 2.1. This policy aims to: 2.1.1. Clarify expectations of conduct for professional services staff 2.1.2. Provide a clear procedure for addressing disciplinary concerns fairly, consistently and in a timely manner 3. Scope 3.1. This policy and procedure apply to all professional services staff outside review periods (see below). Disciplinary matters concerning acade mic staff should be addressed under the Academic Annex. 3.2. This policy and procedure does not apply to new employees du ring their review period (including any extension); disciplinary concerns regarding such staff should be addressed under the Review Periods Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff. 3.3. Disciplinary concerns and underperformance may be linked, al though this is not always the case. Where a manager has concerns about an employee’s underperformance, they should consider the circumstances carefully (consulting HR as appropriate) before a decision is made about which LSE policy is applicable. In partic ular, it should be noted that this policy and procedure do not apply in cases of: • Underperformance that can be attributed to a lack of capability, which should be addressed under the Capability Performance Policy and Procedur e for Professional Services Staff. • Underperformance that can be attributed to a medical condition which may be more appropriately addressed under the Capability Health Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff. • Underperformance that may be due to a disability, such as dyslexia, in which case further advice should be sought from an HR Partner. • Underperformance that can be attribu ted to alcohol or drug dependency which may be more appropriately addressed under the Alcohol and Drugs Policy and/or the Capability Health Policy and Procedure.  3 3.4. A breach of LSE’s Information Security Policy may count as a m isconduct issue and be addressed under this policy and procedure. 4. Responsibilities 4.1. Managers are responsible for: 4.1.1. Familiarising themselves with this policy and procedure 4.1.2. Ensuring that employees are aware of the expected standards of conduct 4.1.3. Providing appropriate feedback to employees and addressing any conduct issues as soon as they become apparent 4.1.4. Providing appropriate guidance, support or other assistance to help emplo yees achieve expected standards of conduct. 4.2. Employees are responsible for: 4.2.1. Seeking clarification if they are unsure about expected standards of conduct 4.2.2. Understanding that their manager is obliged to address any shortfalls in conduct 4.2.3. Advising their man ager of any issues that are affecting their conduct or behaviour, and/or seeking other sources of support (inside and outside LSE). 4.3. Employee representatives and companions are responsible for: 4.3.1. Offering support and assistance to employees, including atten ding formal hearings where requested, as outlined in this policy and procedure. 4.4. HR are responsible for: 4.4.1. Advising managers on the appropriate implementation of this policy and procedure at informal and formal stages 4.4.2. Advising where a suspension may be appropriate during a disciplinary process. 5. Principles 5.1. Certain standards of conduct apply to all LSE staff, as set out in the Ethics Code and Effective Behaviours Framework, among other documents. The standards of conduct which apply to all staff should be communicated during the induction proces s and reinforced throughout employment with the School. If an employee is unsure of the required standards, they should discuss this with their line manager. 5.2. It is expected that concerns about an employee’s behaviour or conduct will usually be first addressed by their line manager through informal approaches. This may include advice and encouragement, training or other means of support. Managers may intervene informally without  4 HR or the presence of employee representatives or companions, with a view to r esolving minor concerns in a timely manner. 5.3. Where informal approaches are either ineffective (i.e. they do not result in a satisfactory improvement) or inappropriate (e.g. cases of alleged gross misconduct), this policy provides a formal procedure. To en sure consistency in the application of the formal procedure, managers must seek the advice of their HR Partner before making any decisions. 5.4. Where formal disciplinary action is being considered, an investigation should be undertaken to determine the relevant facts and any supporting evidence so that an informed discussion and decision can take place. HR (typically the relevant HR Partner) will provide case specific guidance and advice during any such investigation. 5.5. This policy sets out expected timeframes that apply to each stage of the disciplinary procedure. While each applicable stage should be followed without undue delay, it is acknowledg ed that there may be circumstances where it is appropriate to extend a particular timeframe, e.g. to allow further information to be gathered or where there are difficulties in scheduling meetings. Where an extension is necessary, the reasons for doing so will be communicated to all parties. An extension should not be (and should not be seen as) an attempt to delay a stage of the procedure and all participants are expected to show reasonable flexibility in such situations. 5.6. Employment contracts are govern ed by civil law. Decisions taken under the disciplinary procedure set out here will only be made after thorough investigation of the facts presented. Disciplinary sanctions (up to and including dismissal) will only be made where it is more probable than no t that the misconduct occurred. 5.7. Information relating to an allegation of misconduct should only be divulged to parties directly involved in the disciplinary process and must remain strictly confidential to those people. 5.8. At every formal stage of the di sciplinary procedure, the employee will be advised in writing of the nature of any allegations and will have the opportunity to state their case before a decision is made. Where a warning (or other sanction) is given, the employee will be provided with appropriate support to meet the agreed improvement objectives. 5.9. An employee who is the subject of a disciplinary investigation may be accompanied to any formal meeting under this policy and procedure by a representative of a trade union or work colleague. Th e investigating manager and HR should be informed in advance of any such companion. 5.10. Audio recording of meetings, by mobile phone or any other recording device, is not allowed under this policy and procedure. Any information obtained via audio recording w ill not be submissible as evidence. 5.11. Managers should keep in mind that behaviour, or changes in behaviour, may have a reasonable explanation (including related to a protected characteristic, e.g. where disability is a contributing factor) and may not neces sarily constitute misconduct. Managers should therefore avoid making assumptions about potential misconduct and should endeavour to understand the full facts of case before taking formal action under the disciplinary process.  5 6. Equality of opportunity 6.1. LSE is committed to equality of opportunity in the implementation of this policy and procedure. 6.2. Where a disability, as defined by the Equality Act 2010, is disclosed during a disciplinary process, arrangements for investigations (and any subsequent formal meetings) should include consideration of reasonable adjustments to accommodate the disability and enable the individual to play as full a part as possible. In such cases, the individual seeking a reasonable adjustment for a formal meeting held under this policy (e.g. a different companion) should submit their request in writing to the Chair in advance. 6.3. Where an employee has difficulties understanding written or spoken English, appropriate accommodations should be made at every stage of the process, incl uding the provision of a translator where necessary. Further advice may be sought from HR. 7. Right to be accompanied 7.1. Employees have the right to be accompanied to any formal meetings or hearings held under this policy and procedure by either a trade union representative or a work colleague. The employee will be advised of this right prior to any formal meeting or hearing. If the employee wishes to be accompanied and/or call witnesses, they are responsible for providing appropriate details (including the date, time and location of the hearing as well as the details and documentation relating to the matter) to the companion /witness. 7.2. In all cases, the companion should not be someone who is already involved in the issues (and who may therefore need to be interviewed). 7.3. Disciplinary hearings are internal procedures. Attendance as a companion will normally be restricted to tr ade union representatives or employees of LSE. Solicitors, family members and all other non -employees are usually not permitted to attend disciplinary hearings. The employee should advise the Chair of a hearing in advance of the name of the person who will be accompanying them. 7.4. If the employee wishes to be accompanied, they are normally required to provide their HR Partner with the names of their companion at least two working days before the hearing. 7.5. During the hearing, the companion may confer with th e employee and will be allowed to address the hearing to put forward and summarise the employee’s case, respond on the employee’s behalf to views expressed during the hearing, and ask for clarification of any witness statements. The companion is not allowe d to answer any questions that are directly asked to the employee. 7.6. The circumstances of any action to be taken against a representative of a recognised trade union will be notified to the branch secretary (or another individual with a position of office) of that union.  6 7.7. All parties are expected to behave in a professional and respectful manner throughout the duration of a disciplinary process. Further detail about what this means in practice is provided in Section 8 of the procedure. 8. Witnesses 8.1. Witnesses may be called during any formal disciplinary hearing held. Individuals who are not LSE staff will not be interviewed as standard under this policy, although exceptions may be made, e.g. where an individual from outside LSE can provide informatio n about a formal disciplinary matter without which the disciplinary panel’s decision would be different. In such cases, the witness may submit a written statement to the Chair. 8.2. Where an employee wishes to call witnesses for a formal hearing, they are nor mally required to provide their HR Partner with the names of the witness(es) at least two working days before the hearing is due to take place. 8.3. Witnesses are not obliged to attend any formal stages of a disciplinary procedure, and they must not under any circumstances be pressured into doing so. 9. Managing disciplinary procedures remotely 9.1. On occasion, it may be appropriate to hold a formal meeting or hearing either remotely or in a hybrid manner (i.e. where one or more participants join remotely to a me eting which is being held on campus). 9.2. All provisions of the Disciplinary Policy and Procedure apply to hearings and meetings undertaken remotely, including the employee’s right to be accompanied and right of appeal. 9.3. Proceeding with one or more stages of a disciplinary procedure remotely may mean using video (e.g. via Teams). In such circumstances, it should be ensured that: 9.3.1. Everyone involved has access to the appropriate technology, including computer equipment and internet connection (as requi red). Equipment may be required where necessary and should be appropriate to the stage of the process. Where required, a substitute technology may be used – for example, a mobile phone in the event that a laptop is unavailable. 9.3.2. Reasonable adjustments are made as required, e.g. if a participant has a disability or accessibility requirement which may affect their ability to use a particular technology. 9.3.3. Audio of meetings held remotely are not recorded. 9.3.4. Participants still have access to relevant informatio n, including any witness statements or other evidence. 9.4. During an online meeting:  7 9.4.1. Where an employee is accompanied, separate ‘room’ facilities should be arranged so that they can speak in confidence away from the main ‘room’. 9.4.2. Participants should be awar e of the potential challenges of communicating remotely. In particular, participants should be given time to respond to information provided, as well as any decisions, in the same way as during a face -to-face meeting. 9.4.3. Where a participant is finding it dif ficult to maintain a consistent on -screen presence during a meeting (e.g. if there are internet connection difficulties), consideration should be given to postponing and rearranging the meeting. 9.4.4. Participants should be offered breaks in the same way as for an in -person meeting. 9.4.5. Summary notes should be taken and circulated to participants to ensure that all key issues have been understood. 10. Suspension from work 10.1. In certain cases, for example where there is a serious allegation which may constitute gross misconduct, it may be appropriate to suspend an individual from work for a period of time so that an effective investigation can take place. Suspension is a neutra l act and does not in itself imply that there has been any misconduct. 10.2. A suspension should be for the shortest period of time possible whilst allowing an investigation to be carried out. While the length of suspension will vary in individual cases, durin g all suspensions the employee will be kept updated through regular reviews about the timeline of the suspension. In all cases, the decision to suspend must be approved by the Director of HR (except where the Director of HR is unavailable in which case a r easonable delegation may be made) and will be confirmed to the individual in writing. 10.3. A decision to suspend should not be taken lightly, and alternative measures may also be considered depending upon the circumstances, e.g. a part suspension where the em ployee is still able to undertake a more restricted or different set of duties. Effective suspension will also be applicable where an employee no longer has a legal or statutory right to work, and therefore pay will be stopped; the HR Immigration Complianc e team should be consulted in such circumstances. 10.4. LSE reserves the right to suspend an employee at any stage of a disciplinary investigation where it emerges that the matter is potentially one of gross misconduct, or where the employee’s presence at work is affecting the conduct of the investigation. Suspension may also be considered in circumstances where the investigation is causing distress for the employee. 10.5. Where more than one employee is involved in an allegation of misconduct, careful consideratio n should be given regarding fairness if only one individual is suspended due to operational requirements. 10.6. The manager should consult first with their HR Partner if they are considering the suspension of an employee. If the suspension is approved by the Director of HR (or appropriate delegate), the manager will then meet with the employee to explain the reasons for the decision;  8 an HR Partner may also attend. The employee will be sent written confirmation of the suspension within three working days of the meeting, along with a copy of this policy and procedure. The written confirmation will also advise the emplo yee of the expected duration of their suspension, an appropriate point of contact during this period and any conditions about attending the workplace and making contact with other staff or witnesses. 10.7. In certain cases, it may be appropriate for a manager other than the employee’s immediate line manager to undertake the suspension. In these circumstances, the employee will be advised of the reasons during the meeting and afterwards in writing. 10.8. Suspension will be on full pay (including overtime payments wh ere the individual works regular overtime) and may be in place until the investigation is concluded and/or a formal disciplinary hearing is convened. 10.9. During any period of suspension from work, regular contact should be maintained by the Chair of the rele vant part of the process, so that the employee is kept updated about the progress of the investigation and timeline of the suspension. 10.10. The employee should be notified in writing when their suspension is due to end. If no further action is to be taken as a result of the investigation, a meeting should be arranged so that the employee is supported with any outstanding workload as well as any other developments (e.g. training) that they may have missed during their suspension. 11. Police or other legal proce edings 11.1. LSE reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action in circumstances where the police are investigating a matter which involves one or more employees, or where legal proceedings have commenced, should such circumstances or proceedings ha ve a bearing on an employee’s performance in their role or contractual obligations. It may be necessary to take disciplinary action before the outcome of the police investigation or legal proceedings is known. 12. Misconduct and gross misconduct 12.1. The following examples of misconduct and gross misconduct are for indicative or illustrative purposes only and are not exhaustive. 12.2. Misconduct 12.2.1. ‘Misconduct’ is considered to be behaviour which is in breach of LSE’s expected standards of conduct, as expressed in LSE documents including (though not limited to) the Ethics Code and Effective Behaviours Framework. 12.2.2. Examples of misconduct may include: • Unauthorised absence and unsatisfactory timekeeping • Refusing to comply with reasonable instructions from a supervisor or manager  9 • Breach of confidentiality, LSE regulations or conditions of employment. 12.3. Gross misconduct 12.3.1. ‘Gross misconduct’ is conduct serious enough to destroy the contract between the employee and the employer, making any further working relationship or trust between the two parties impossible. If, on completion of a disciplinary investigation and subsequent hearing, LSE is satisfied that gross misconduct has oc curred, the result will normally be summary dismissal without notice or pay in lieu of notice. 12.3.2. Examples of gross misconduct include: • Acts of theft, fraud or deliberate falsification of records, or use of LSE premises or assets for personal gain • Physical or verbal abuse of a colleague, member of the public or employee of an organisation that has business with LSE • Bullying (including cyber bullying) and/or harassment • The possession of illegal drugs or incapacity due to drunkenness or unauthorise d drug taking on LSE premises or on LSE business • Racial, sexual or other acts of harassment or discriminatory behaviour, including sexual misconduct on LSE premises or on LSE business • A failure to abide by LSE’s Personal Relationships Policy • Acts of g ross insubordination, or refusal to comply with reasonable management requests • Serious negligence • Soliciting or the acceptance of bribes • Wilful or negligent misuse or damage to LSE property or the property of employees causing unacceptable financial l oss • Serious breaches of confidentiality, LSE regulations or conditions of employment (including knowing or reckless disclosures of personal data in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) • Conviction for an offence outside of work affecting staff or external relations, or the employee's ability to perform effectively in the role for which they were employed. 13. Right of appeal  10 13.1. Employees have the right of appeal against all formal written de cisions made under this policy and procedure (up to a final appeal decision) in accordance with the separate Appeals Procedure for Professional Services Staff. This right will be included in the written confirmation of such decisions, along with the name o f the person to whom an appeal should be addressed and the timescale for doing so. 13.2. Usual grounds for an appeal will be the coming to light of new information, procedural irregularities or alleged unreasonableness of the decision. The scope of an appeal hearing is to: 13.2.1. Review whether the matter under consideration was adequately investigated and substantiated 13.2.2. Review whether LSE’s procedures were correctly and fairly implemented 13.2.3. Consider any new evidence (if any is presented) 13.2.4. Consider whether the disciplinary action was reasonable given the circumstances known to management at the time of the hearing. 13.3. If new evidence is introduced during an appeal hearing, that evidence may be referred to the original formal hearing so that t he level of sanction may be reviewed. 13.4. If an appeal results in the reinstatement of an employee who has been dismissed, this will be done in a manner which maintains continuous service and without any loss of pay. 13.5. The appeal decision is final and there is no further internal right of appeal. 14. GDPR and case records 14.1. Notes and records of matters addressed under this policy and procedure should be handled on a confidential basis and stored securely in line with LSE’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) obligations and the School’s own data protection guidance. 14.2. The written outcomes of all disciplinary actions taken will be monitored centrally by HR. Spent disciplinary records may be retained in a separate file for reference in the event of a dispute or legal proceedings, but not for reference in the event of furth er actions considered under this policy and procedure. The retention and subsequent removal of such records will be carried out in accordance with GDPR. 15. Criminal Offences 15.1. If an employee is charged with or convicted of a criminal offence (other than a driving offence), they must inform their line manager immediately. The conviction is not normally in itself reason for disciplinary action; however, consideration will be given to what effect any charge or conviction has on the employee’s suitability to do the job and their relationship with LSE, colleagues and service users. Managers should consult HR for advice about how to proceed in these circumstances. 16. Further support  11 16.1. Managers and employees are encouraged to seek further clarification and advice as required from HR on the application of this policy and procedure. Staff can also contact LSE’s recognised trade unions as well as the School’s staff networks. 16.2. Throughout a ll stages of a disciplinary process, staff and managers are encouraged to access, and to signpost others to, relevant support within LSE, including Staff Counselling services and the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) as appropriate.  12 Disciplinary Pr ocedure for Professional Services Staff 1. Introduction 1.1. Where there are concerns about an employee’s conduct, their line manager should, in the first instance, discuss these with the relevant HR Partner. The HR Partner will consider the issues and advise on the options for addressing them, depending on the natu re of the alleged (mis)conduct. Clarification of what constitutes misconduct, as well as examples of potential offences of gross misconduct, may be found in Section 12. Misconduct and gross misconduct of the policy. 1.2. Except in cases of alleged (or proven) gross misconduct, the employee should have reasonable time to meet the agreed improvement objectives. 1.3. If, at any point in a disciplinary process, it is determined that there is no case to answer, this will be confirmed in writing. 2. Informal action 2.1. Managers should bring to the attention of employees any incidences of failure to meet expected standards of conduct as part of normal line management. Cases of minor misconduct should be addressed informally and promptly via a confidential one -to-one discus sion between the employee and their line manager. This discussion enables the manager to provide constructive feedback and the employee to express their views. 2.2. Where the manager identifies a need for improvement, they should explain to the employee what n eeds to be done, how the employee’s conduct will be reviewed in a given period, and the nature of any support available. Support may include any necessary learning or training opportunities to help the employee reach the required standard. 2.3. Following the meeting, the manager should make a brief confidential note of what was discussed, including details of any required actions or improvements, and share this with the employee. 2.4. At the end of the agreed timescales, or earlier if it becomes apparent that the improvements required cannot be achieved within the defined time period, the employee’s conduct will be reviewed and a decision taken as to whether any further action (including formal action) is necessary. 2.5. Where informal action satisfactorily resolves a conduct concern, the matter will be considered finished and will not be recorded on the employee’s file. Informal action is not part of the formal disciplinary procedure and employees are not entitled to representation at these meetings. 2.6. Where informal action does not lead to improved behaviour, or where the alleged misconduct is more serious so that informal action is inappropriate (e.g. gross misconduct), the formal procedure may be initiated. The formal procedure will typically begin with an investigation.  13 3. Investigation 3.1. Where formal disciplinary action is being considered, it is LSE policy that an investigation is undertaken to determine the facts and gather any supporting evidence so that an informed discussion and decision can take place. The nature and duration of the investigation will vary depending on individual circumstances, although the following provides general guidance about what is expected. Depending upon the circumstances, it may be appropriate to suspend one or more employee s for a period of time while the investigation is carried out (see Section 10. Suspension from work in the policy). 3.2. The investigation should be undertaken by a named individual (the ‘investigating officer’). This will normally be the immediate line manage r although an alternative individual may undertake the role, e.g. if the line manager is directly involved in the substance of an allegation, in which case the employee will be advised of the reasons. The investigation will typically include discussions wi th the employee and any relevant witnesses about the matters under consideration. Written records will be taken of the discussions and any necessary documentation gathered. In complex cases, it may be necessary to meet again with a witness or member of sta ff, or request written submissions from them if information needs to be corroborated or clarified. The timetable for gathering evidence should be discussed with all parties and an update should be provided to the employee within a maximum of ten working da ys (where the evidence gathering stage is expected to take longer). 3.3. Disciplinary investigations should be given priority and every effort should be made to minimise delays. Where the investigating officer considers that an extension is necessary (i.e. where they need more time to gather sufficient information), this should be agreed with the relevant HR Partner and the employee should be advised in writing of the reasons for the extension as well as the likely timescale for completion. 3.4. The investigati ng officer should liaise with the HR Partner so that a formal meeting can be set up to interview the employee in question as well as any witnesses who may be able to shed light on the alleged misconduct. These meetings should be undertaken promptly and the findings noted in writing. These written notes are not a verbatim record but will contain the key representations made at the meeting. Each person interviewed will be provided with a copy of the notes following the meeting and will be asked to confirm tha t the notes are an accurate record. 3.5. The employee in question (as well as any witnesses) has the right to be accompanied to any formal meeting held as part of the investigation (or subsequent hearing). An HR representative will also be present in an advis ory role and a separate HR representative may also be present to take a summary note of the meeting. 3.6. Following the investigation meetings, the investigating officer (with advice from HR) will review the notes and any other evidence. In complex cases, it may be necessary to meet again with one or more individuals, or request written submissions from them, if any information needs to be corroborated or clarified. 3.7. Based on their investigations, the investigating officer may recommend that:  14 • There is no case to answer, or • The matter is appropriately addressed through informal actions that fall short of a disciplinary hearing (e.g. training), or • There are sufficient grounds to progress to a formal disciplinary hearing. 3.8. If the investigating of ficer recommends no formal action or informal actions only, the employee will be informed of this in writing. 3.9. If the investigating officer decides to refer the matter to a formal hearing, a hearing should be convened without undue delay. In line with the policy, the formal procedure may be entered at any stage, depending on the seriousness of the case. Ahead of the hearing, the investigating officer will need to prepare a report which summarises the investigation and makes a recommendation. This should in clude the notes of all investigation meetings as well as any other evidence gathered during the investigation. HR may assist with the preparation of the report, if necessary. 4. Stages of disciplinary action 4.1. The formal procedure allows for a total of four stages of disciplinary action. These stages will typically be followed in order until a matter is resolved, although the appropriateness of the sanction may also be determined by the seriousness of the disciplinary hearing findings (e.g. in cases of gross misconduct). 4.2. The outcome of each stage will be confirmed in writing to the employee. This written confirmation will include any improvement targets that have been agreed, and will advise the employee that further action under the next stage will be cons idered if these improvement targets are not met. The confirmation letter will also advise the employee of their right of appeal, and be accompanied by a copy of the Appeals Procedure for Professional Services Staff. 4.3. Written confirmation of first warnings and written warnings will be retained on the employee’s file for a specific period of time (see Sections 10, 11 and 12 of this procedure as relevant), after which they will be removed. If no formal disciplinary action is to be taken as a result of a disciplinary hearing, the employee will be notified in writing. 5. Arranging a disciplinary hearing 5.1. The formal stages of the disciplinary procedure are designed to allow a case to progress through the normal management chain. The hearing will therefore normally be chaired by the line manager's manager. Where an alternative arrangement is required, a written explanation will be provided. 5.2. The manager chairing the hearing will be accompanied by a HR Partner acting as advisor and a second HR repr esentative, who will take a written record of the meeting. 6. Notification of disciplinary hearings  15 6.1. Where it is considered that a disciplinary hearing is necessary, the manager convening the hearing will write to the employee, normally within ten working d ays of receiving the investigation report, giving the employee at least five working days’ notice so that they have sufficient time to prepare a response. The written notification of the hearing must include: • The time, date and location of the hearing • Details of the matter to be considered • Any documentation relevant to the matter (including the line manager’s report and any witness statements) • The employee’s right to be accompanied • Who will be in attendance from Human Resources • Whether translation serv ices are required (where necessary) • The requirement to confirm attendance, usually within 48 hours of the meeting • The requirement, where relevant, that documents which are to be submitted in advance to the Chair, should be sent within 48 hours of the meeti ng • Support services provided by LSE 6.2. The employee (and their companion if they are to be accompanied) should take all reasonable steps to attend the hearing. If the employee is unable to attend on the given date, they should request an alternative date and time which should be within five working days of the original date. 6.3. If an employee’s chosen companion is unavailable on the given date, the employee should request a postponement by proposing an alternative date and time which should be within five work ing days of the original date. Where this is not possible, the employee should choose an alternative person to accompany them. 6.4. Where all reasonable efforts to secure an alternative date have been unsuccessful, LSE reserves the right to hold disciplinary hearings in absentia. This must be communicated to the employee in writing in such circumstances. 7. Composition of panel at disciplinary hearings 7.1. A formal disciplinary hearing will normally include the following: • A manager who will act as Chair and d ecide on the appropriate action • The employee who is the focus of the hearing • The employee’s companion (if applicable) • The investigating officer (normally the employee’s line manager) • An HR Partner • Another HR representative (where required) who attends i n an administrative capacity to take notes 8. Conduct during disciplinary hearings  16 8.1. All parties are expected to behave in a professional and respectful manner during any hearings held under this procedure. In particular, while disciplinary hearings or meetings can be stressful and tense occasions, all parties can help by: 8.1.1. Preparing in a dvance so that there are no undue delays and all parties have access to the relevant information 8.1.2. During the hearing itself, k eeping discussions to the matter at hand (following a structured outline should help to make sure that the discussions stay relevan t) 8.1.3. Behaving in a constructive and considerate manner by giving others the chance to respond, minimising interruptions, and avoiding any behaviour which could be seen as unreasonably influencing anyone’s participation in the process or the outcome. 8.2. Section 9 of the policy includes further details that are applicable when conducting a hearing in which one or more parties are participating remotely. 9. Procedure at disciplinary hearings This section sets out the general procedure to be followed at disciplinary hearings. 9.1. The Chair will introduce the hearing by explain ing the purpose of the hearing, introduc ing the parties and outlin ing the procedure to be followed. The hearing should be an objective review of the case which allows all parties to hear and commen t on the matters under consideration before a decision is made. 9.2. Following the Chair’s introduction, t he employee’s line manager or investigating officer (as relevant) will present their case. They may then be asked questions by the Chair for the purpose of clarification, by the employee (and/or companion) and by the HR representative. 9.3. The employee (or companion if the employee is accompanied) will then have the opportunity to state their case, including whether there are any special circumstances to be taken into account. The employee may also present evidence and raise points about any information provided by witnesses. The employee may then be asked questions by the Chair, by the investigating officer and by the HR representative. Any questions put directly to the employee should be answered by them and not by their companion. 9.4. Both employees and investigating officers can call witnesses, either during their statement or after questioning has taken place. If witnesses are called, they may only be present for the period of their statements and any questions that they are asked. Witnesses will be questioned first by the person who called them, then in turn by the other side, the Chair and the HR representative, as necessary. The Chair reserves the right to call further witnesses at any stage of the hearing if they feel that it would be helpful to do so for clarification. 9.5. During the hearing, it may be appropriate to arrange an adjournment to seek further information. All parties can request an adjournment through the hearing’s Chair. 9.6. After each side has presented their case, and each side has had the opportunity to ask qu estions of clarification, the Chair will ask the employee and then the investigating officer to sum up. 9.7. The Chair should consider what was said at the hearing, re -reading any documentation if necessary, before making a decision. Factors that may be taken into account include the employee’s overall disciplinary and general record, length of service, actions taken in any  17 previous similar cases, the explanations provided by the employee and whether the intended action is reasonable in the circumstances. HR ca n provide guidance as appropriate. 9.8. If appropriate (e.g. if the amount of documentation is relatively brief), the decision can be made on the same day as the hearing, following a period of adjournment. At the latest, the decision should be confirmed to th e employee in writing within 5 days of the hearing. The written confirmation of the decision will include the employee’s right of appeal along with a copy of the Appeals Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff. 10. Stage 1 – first written warni ng 10.1. If, following the hearing, the Chair finds that misconduct (short of gross misconduct) has occurred, they may issue a first warning to the employee. The warning will be confirmed in writing and a copy placed on the employee’s file for a period of one y ear. The warning will include the improvement(s) required and their timescales. 11. Stage 2 – second written warning 11.1. A second written warning applies to more serious acts of misconduct, or to a repeat of misconduct for which the employee has previously rec eived a warning under Stage 1. 11.2. The warning will be confirmed in writing and a copy placed on the employee’s file for a period of one year. The warning will include the improvement(s) required and their timescales. 12. Stage 3 – final (or first and final) written warning 12.1. A final written warning is appropriate for a repetition of misconduct for which the employee has previously received a written warning under Stage 2 of the procedure. 12.2. A first and final written warning is appropriate for acts of misconduct so serious that LSE would wish to dismiss the employee were those acts to be subsequently repeated. 12.3. A final (or first and final) written warning will remain on the employee’s file for a period of two years. The warn ing will give details of the misconduct, the improvements required and their timescales. 12.4. Written confirmation of a final written warning will advise the employee that dismissal under Stage 4 of the procedure will be considered if there is no satisfactory improvement. 13. Stage 4 – dismissal or summary dismissal 13.1. ‘Dismissal’ may apply to third, second or first repetitions of minor, serious or major misconduct respectively. 13.2. ‘Summary dismissal’ (dismissal without notice) applies to acts of gross misconduct only.  18 14. Dismissal 14.1. If the employee’s conduct is still unsatisfactory following a warning under Stage 3, and this is upheld at a disciplinary hearing, the employee will be dismissed as long as the relevant amount of time for the sanction to remain on file has not passed. The employee will be provided with a written explanation for the dismissal by the Chair of the hearing. 14.2. If dismissal is confirmed, the employee will receiv e pay in lieu of their contractual notice, as well as any other outstanding monies due, unless the dismissal was a summary dismissal (see above). For calculation purposes, the employee’s final date of employment will be the date on which the employee was f irst informed of the outcome of the disciplinary hearing; this could be verbally at the hearing itself or subsequently in writing. 15. Summary dismissal 15.1. Summary dismissal only applies in cases of gross misconduct. In such cases, the employee will normally be suspended on full pay (see Section 10. Suspension from work in the policy ) whilst their line manager completes an investigation. 15.2. If it is found that an act of gross misconduct has taken place, the employee will be summarily dismissed without notice (or pay in lieu of notice) and the decision will be confirmed in writing. The last day of service will be the date on which the employee received the outcome of the disciplinary hearing. 16. Appeals and grievances 16.1. Employees are entitled to appeal as set out in Section 13. Right of appeal in the policy. 16.2. If an employee raises a grievance during an ongoing disciplinary procedure, the proced ure may be paused so that the grievance can be addressed first. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to address both at the same time where the grievance and disciplinary cases are related.  19 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years November 2025 May 2025 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 August 2017 JNICC 2 November 2022 JNICC Links Reference Link Capability Performance Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/capPerPolPSSSta.pdf Capability Health Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/capHeaProAcaSupSta.pdf Alcohol and Drugs Policy https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/alcDruPol.pdf Information Security Policy https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/infSecPol.pdf Contacts Position Name Email Notes Senior HR Policy Adviser Kieran Darling k.darling1@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': '1 Introduction LSE acknowledges that effective flexible working can lead to improved employee wellbeing, engagement and job satisfaction. As an employer, the School also recognises that enabling employees to satisfactorily balance their work and personal lives may have a positive impact on staff productivity, retention and delivery of LSE’s strategic objectives. This policy sets out the ways in which LSE will strive to positively support all employees, whether they are working parents, carers or simply seeking an alternat ive working pattern to improve their own work -life balance. Flexible working can vary in shape and form. Effective flexible working is dependent upon both the employee and employer working together to meet the mutual needs of the individual and LSE. Good communication, planning and trust are all key components to developing successful flexible working arrangements. All flexible working requests will be treated positively and in a constructive spirit. At the same time, it is recognised that not all flexible working patterns will be able to be accommodated. Where a formal request cannot be confirmed, the employee will receive written confirmation and, providing that the request is made under the statutory provisions, they will have the right to appeal the decision. Managers should consult with their HR Partners for information and support on flexible working. This pol icy supports the work -life balance of LSE staff through arrangements agreed individually between employees and line managers. Such flexible working arrangements are separate from working practices under LSE’s Blended Working Policy although they may complement each other, i.e. an employee may have an individual flexible working arrangement in place in addition to working in a b lended way at a team level. This policy is supported by a Flexible Working Toolkit which provides in -depth guidance about the process for requesting and approving flexible working requests. Policy Aims This policy and procedure aim to ensure that: • LSE continues to develop a working culture which is flexible about the ways in which work is delivered, whilst supporting employees to balance their work and home life. Flexible Working Policy and Procedure Operational 2 • Where individual requests for flexible working are made, that these are handled in a fair, reasonable and timely manner. • In LSE’s approach to flexible working, it is a diverse, inclusive, fair and flexible employer that attracts and retains diverse and high calibre talent, whilst also supporti ng the career progression of all staff during their employment with the School. Scope of Policy This policy applies to all LSE employees. The section below (Legislative Framework ) sets out the statutory context for formal flexible working requests. As part of its commitment to support better work -life balance, LSE has removed the 26 weeks’ continuous service requirement for staff – i.e. employees can submit a flexible working reque st from their first day of employment. In addition, managers are encouraged to consider flexible working opportunities during the recruitment process, including using the ‘Happy to Talk Flexible Working’ logo when advertising roles, incorporating flexible working options into job design, and having discussions about flexible working possibilities with both internal and external candidates. While LSE will endeavour to consider all requests for flexible working from individuals who do not meet the statutory criteria (including from offer holders), it may not always be possible to keep to the statutory timescales as set out in the Flexible Working Procedure. Legislative Framework This policy and procedure is written in accordance with the Acas Code of Practice ‘ Handling in a reasonable manner requests to work flexibly ’. Under The Children and Families Act (2014), all employees are able to apply for flexible working, which is defined as a permanent change to their terms and conditions, providing they meet the following criteria: • They have worked for LSE continuously for 2 6 weeks at the time the request is made. • They have not made another application in the previous twelve months. Under the Equality Act 2010, it is considered unlawful discrimination to decline a flexible working request due to a protected characteristic (r ace, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, religion or belief, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity). In line with its obligations under the Part -time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulation s 2000, LSE will ensure that part -time workers do not receive less favourable access to flexible working or unfavourable treatment as a result of a flexible working request, unless it can be justified on wholly objective grounds. Definitions To ensure clarity, the following definitions apply to terms found in this policy and procedure: Flexible working : a non -standard work pattern which is requested by an individual employee and agreed with their line manager. Flexible working may be requested for a wide range of reasons, typically with the overall aim of supporting the employee’s work -life balance. A f lexible working arrangement may be informal or formal. Informal flexible working : may be agreed locally without reference to HR. Informal flexible working typically applies to temporary (rather than ongoing) arrangements that do not affect 3 an employee’s pay, e.g. an agreement for the employee to start and finish later for a relatively brief period of time to accommodate a temporary change of circumstances. Formal flexible working : a non -standard work pattern which is requested by an employee using the formal request form (see the Flexible Working Procedure). Where agreed, the new work pattern constitutes a permanent (i.e. ongoing) and contractual change to the employee’s conditions of employment with LSE. The Flexible Working Procedure should be followed where formal flexible working is requested; the procedure includes a formal meet ing (where required) so that the request can be discussed in more detail and a right of appeal if the employee wishes to appeal against a decision made under the procedure. Blended working : refers to LSE’s approach to enabling a working culture which is more responsive to the specific activities of a particular role and to work -life balance of staff by taking advantage of more efficient technologies and workspace design. In practice, this means a mixture of on -campus and remote working for many staff, in line with the requirements of their role. Flexible working at LSE LSE endeavours to create a working culture which is positive about flexible working. Information about flexible working will be made available to new starters as part of their induction and regular discussions are encouraged throughout employment with the School (e.g. as part of a line -manager’s catch -ups with staff). Flexible working arrangements may be formal or informal. Where an employee wishes to request a permanent (i.e. ongoing) and contractual change to their working pattern, location and/or hours, they should submit a formal request under the formal Flexible Working Procedure. Alternatively, informal flexible working arrangements can be agreed locally between the line manager an d employee. Informal arrangements do not constitute a contractual change to the employee’s terms and conditions, and are typically agreed where a change is for a temporary period or is relatively minor. A number of good examples of flexible working arrangements exist in LSE, both formal and informal. The School’s introduction of blended working may mean that individual staff are working a flexible arrangement (e.g. part -time hours) alongside a blended approach in th eir team (i.e. a mix of on - campus and remote working). Managers are encouraged to be open to the prospect of employees working flexibly and all parties should be creative in thinking about ways in which flexibility can be achieved without a negative impa ct upon the work of the individual or the wider team. Managers should appreciate that employees can face challenging decisions about how best to balance their work with outside commitments. Employees must not feel pressured to request sub -optimal arrangeme nts in lieu of flexible options that would better suit their circumstances, and managers should be aware of such factors when considering requests. For example, a request for part -time working from a parent or carer may be motivated by the employee’s desir e to have greater control over their working hours rather than a desire to work less. In such situations, informal discussions have an important role to play by giving employee and manager the opportunity to freely discuss potential solutions. Informal f lexible working Where an employee is not seeking to permanently alter their working arrangements but a situation arises that requires a degree of flexibility, they should speak with their line manager about informal (temporary) arrangements. While informal flexible working may be agreed locally without reference to HR, line managers are also welcome to discuss the implications of an informal flexible working request with their HR Partner. 4 Formal flexible working LSE will consider all formal flexible working requests in a fair and consistent way. All employees who submit a formal request will have the opportunity of a meeting to discuss the implications of their request and to which the employee may be accompanied, except where their r equest is approved without the need for such a meeting. Managers can only consider a request in the context of how readily it can be accommodated at that point in time and in the immediate future. As such, approved requests will not set a precedent tha t all similar future requests will also be accommodated. Where it is not possible for a request to be approved, a business reason will be provided and the right to appeal will be offered (where the request being made is covered by the statutory provisions). It is advisable that all formal flexible working arrangements should have a trial period built into the agreement, usually of up to six months. Once the arrangements have been confirmed, they will become a permanent change to the individual’s terms and conditions of employment. The Formal Flexible Working Procedure accompanies this policy and outlines the statutory requirements for considering such requests. Flexible working procedure Introduction This procedure details the steps necessary to apply the Flexible Working Policy so that staff can make formal requests for flexible working. Formal flexible working decisions should be made by the line manager in a timely manner, and, at the latest, with in three months of the request being made unless an extension is mutually agreed. Line managers should seek the advice of their HR Partner if they have any questions or concerns about the implications of a flexible working request. Types of flexible work ing ‘Flexible working’ refers to any type of non -standard working arrangement that is agreed between an employee and their line manager, and which constitutes a change to the employee’s contracted hours and/or location of work. There are a number of flexi ble working options, or combinations, which can be considered. The following list, though not exhaustive, summarises some of the most common arrangements. Further details about flexible working options can be found in the Flexible Working Toolkit. • Compre ssed hours : an employee works their usual full -time hours in fewer days. There is typically no reduction of pay or pension contributions under a compressed hours arrangement, although there may be implications for the employee’s annual leave entitlement. • Flexitime : an employee requests to vary their start and/or finish times. While a reasonable level of flexibility regarding start/finish times is feasible for many jobs, employees and 5 managers should be mindful that any proposed arrangements are not likely to negatively impact on wellbeing or service delivery. • Homeworking : where an employee carries out their usual work at home. Requests to work from home made under the Flexible Working Procedure should be distinguished from teams working remotely for part of the working week under LSE’s Blended Working Policy. Employees who wish to request to work from home on particular days of the week may do so under a flexible working request. Guidance on remote working can be found here which may be useful for staff who are homeworking under a flexible working arrangement. • Job sharing : where a full -time post is divided into two (or more) part tim e roles and duties and responsibilities are shared. • Part-time working : when an employee reduces their contracted hours to work e.g. Monday – Wednesday. This has implications for salary, pension and holiday entitlement. • Term -time working : where an employe e reduces their hours to take time off during school holidays. • Transition to retirement : a reduction in the hours worked but involves the same or very nearly the same job responsibilities, to help support an employee’s transition to retirement. Please see the Retirement Policy for further information. Steps for making a formal flexible working application How to apply Employees are encouraged to discuss the implications of a potential flexible working arrangement informally with their line manager before submitting a formal request. This is an opportunity to discuss the expected benefits of the proposed arrangement as w ell as to explore alternatives if appropriate. An employee and line manager can also agree a more informal flexible working arrangement on a temporary basis (see Section 7. Informal flexible working of the policy), e.g. to see the impact of an arrangement before a formal request is made. If the employee decides that they wish to make a formal flexible working request, they should do so via the ‘flexible working request form’. When completing the formal request form, the employee should carefully consider the information required and the advantages and disadvantages of their request; the potential impact of the request on the manager, team and colleagues; the impact on the service provided; and how potential obstacles could be overcome. By thinking this thr ough at the request stage, it will help with the next steps in this procedure. After the employee has completed their section of the request form, they should submit the form to their line manager, who may contact the relevant HR Partner to discuss the proposal and to seek advice. The line manager should then arrange a formal meeting with the employee, unless the manager intends to app rove the request in which case a meeting is not needed. Where a meeting is required, this should happen as soon as reasonably possible and at the latest within 28 days of receiving the request, unless both agree that this time can be extended. While an HR representative (typically the relevant HR Partner) will not ordinarily attend the meeting, they may do so if requested by the line manager and/or the employee. The employee may, if they wish, be accompanied by a work colleague or trade union representative. The meeting gives the manager and employee the opportunity to discuss the request itself in more detail, find out more about the proposed working arrangements and the benefits and possible challenges. 6 Each flexible working request should be considere d on a case -by-case basis and will not create a precedent within a team, i.e. a decision made concerning one request may not necessarily be repeated for subsequent requests if doing so would present operational or other difficulties. HR will write to the employee within 14 days of the meeting taking place, to confirm whether or not the flexible working request has been agreed. If the flexible working request is successful It is recommended that a trial period, usually of around six months with an agreed start and end date, is built into any flexible working arrangement, to see how the arrangement works in practice. The flexible working arrangement should be regularly discus sed during one -to-one meetings and any concerns should be considered and documented well in advance of the end of the trial period. If the flexible working arrangement cannot be agreed after the trial period, the employee will revert back to their previous working arrangement unless both employee and manager agree a suitable alternative. If the manager and employee agree the original flexible working request or a variation thereof, the manager should write to their HR Partner and send across a summary of t he agreed changes. The HR Administrators team will then issue a letter confirming the relevant changes. A formal flexible working arrangement constitutes a permanent change to an employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Normally, an employee may not make a further formal flexible working request for at least 12 months. If an employee’s flexible working arrangement means a reduction in hours, this will have an implication on their salary and benefits such as pensions. Employees can contact their HR A dviser if they have any questions about this. If the flexible working request is unsuccessful If there are difficulties agreeing to the original request, reasonable efforts should be made by the manager and employee to discuss alternative patterns or a rrangements and to consider compromise options. Where a request cannot be agreed, a written business reason must be given to the employee and will relate to one or more of the following reasons: • the burden of additional costs; • an inability to reorganis e work amongst existing staff; • an inability to recruit additional staff; • a detrimental impact on quality; • a detrimental impact on performance; • detrimental effect on ability to meet customer demand; • insufficient work for the periods the employee proposes to work; • a planned structural change to LSE. Where it is not possible to agree to a request to work flexibly, a letter will be sent to the employee confirming the decision, the business reason(s) and the employee’s right of appeal. Right of appeal Employees can appeal a decision related to a formal flexible working request by submitting an appeal in writing within 14 days of being notified of the decision. The appeal should be sent to the manager of the line manager who made the original decision and should clearly state the grounds on which they are appealing. 7 The appeal meeting should convene within 14 days and will usually be chaired by the line manager’s manager; in some cases, an appropriate alternative manager may chair the meeting, e.g. if the manager who received the appeal is unavaila ble. The employee’s line manager will attend the meeting to explain the reasons for their decision. There will also be an HR representative, typically the relevant HR Partner. Employees should make every reasonable effort to attend the appeal meeting an d be prepared to discuss their application in an open and constructive manner. They have the right to be accompanied by a work colleague or trade union representative at any meetings connected with the appeal. The manager hearing the appeal will have the right to uphold or reject it. The outcome of the appeal should be confirmed to the employee in writing within 14 days of the appeal meeting. If it is upheld, a letter issued by HR will confirm the new working pattern and the date from which the new arrange ment is to take effect. The line manager will be notified of the reasons and given suggestions regarding what arrangements can be made to accommodate the working practice. Where the appeal is unsuccessful, the letter will advise the employee of the reason( s) for the decision. The decision following the appeal is final in terms of LSE’s internal procedures. Further information and advice Staff and managers can contact their HR Partner or HR Adviser if they would like further advice or information about flexible working. More information about flexible working, including explanations of different types of working pattern and more detail about the formal request process, can be found in the Flexible Working Toolkit. In addition to the Toolkit, LSE also embeds understanding of good practice about flexible working through dedicated training for managers. 8 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years 17/11/2025 17/08/2025 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 01/11/2016 JNICC 2 17/11/2022 JNICC Links Reference Link ACAS website https://www.acas.org.uk/acas -code -of-practice -on-flexible -working -requests Contacts Position Name Email Notes Kieran Darling Senior HR Policy Adviser k.darling1@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

Policy implementation and review Special Leave Policy Operational 2 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE is committed to developing a work culture that supports the work -life balance and wellbeing of employees. As part of this commitment, LSE recognises that there may be occasions when employees need to take time off work for reasons that are not necessarily covered under LSE’s: • Annual leave policies • Family leave policies (i.e. maternity and adoption, paternity, parental and sh ared parental leave) • Sickness absence procedures • Provisions for staff to take time off to achieve professional qualifications or undertake a course of study (although such time off may also be agreed as unpaid under this policy). • Leave types that apply spe cifically to academic roles (e.g. research leave). Details of the above benefits may be found in their respective policies. This policy sets out the range of leave options that are available to enable employees to address more unusual circumstances (incl uding taking leave at short notice), supporting them in achieving an appropriate balance between their work and personal commitments. 1.2. This policy is part of LSE’s commitment to supporting a diverse and inclusive working environment. In line with the Equa lity Act 2010, no individuals requesting leave under this policy will be discriminated against or treated unfairly because of a protected characteristic. Subject to any eligibility criteria, all of these types of leave are available to all staff within the diverse LSE community, including LGBTQ+ and same -sex families. 1.3. This policy is accompanied by an Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) which aims to identify the policy’s impact in terms of protected characteristics as well as ways in which any negative impact may be mitigated. Further details about LSE’s EIA process can be found on the EDI webpages. 2. Policy aims 2.1. The aim of this policy is to establish a fair and reasonable approach to handling non - standard leave requests so that there is a consistent approach in line with employment legislation, good employment practice and LSE’s commitment to creating an inclusive and supportive work environment. 2.2. Through this policy and its complementary resources, LSE aims to: • Contribute to a working environment in which staff have access to a clear set of leave options for a range of non -standard and unexpected scenarios; • Enco urage supportive discussions between employees and line managers so that staff can maintain a satisfactory work -life balance which includes the ability to take reasonable time away from work for personal reasons and those related to certain public duties. 3 3. Policy scope 3.1. This policy and its supporting guidance apply to all LSE staff, whether on a permanent or fixed -term contract. 3.2. Under the Agency Worker Regulations 2010, after 12 continuous weeks in the same job, agency workers are entitled to the same b asic terms and conditions as if they had been recruited directly by LSE – this includes basic pay, ability to apply for internal vacancies and annual leave. Individuals who reach 12 continuous weeks’ service in this way can request and take leave under thi s policy in the same way as staff appointed on a permanent or fixed - term basis. 3.3. The leave options set out in this policy do not form part of the contract of employment and will not normally apply to casual or agency workers who have not worked for 12 con tinuous weeks in the same job. In addition, i ndividuals working at LSE on a temporary or ad -hoc basis may not be eligible for certain statutory provisions set out in this policy. For example, the Employment Rights Act 1996 which allows individuals time off to undertake certain public duties does not apply to independent contractors or freelance agents. LSE still has a duty of care towards such individuals and managers are encouraged to respond sympathetically regarding any personal situations outside the wo rkplace, especially those related to the care or wellbeing of dependants. 4. Polic y responsibilities 4.1. Employees are responsible for • Following the notification procedures set out in this policy, depending upon the type of leave being requested. • Where leave needs to be requested or taken unexpectedly or at short notice, letting their line manager know as soon as possible and making reasonable efforts to keep the manager updated during any agreed period of absence from work. 4.2. Line managers are responsibl e for • Considering all leave requests under this policy sensitively, fairly and reasonably. • Supporting employees during any situations that are impacting on wellbeing, including signposting to resources as appropriate. 4.3. HR are responsible for • Advising m anagers and staff on the implementation of this policy. • Receiving completed and approved requests made using the Special Leave Request Form and notifying Payroll where an agreed arrangement has pay implications. 4.4. Payroll are responsible for 4 • Processing all leave requests that have implications for an employee’s pay, especially periods of unpaid leave agreed under this policy. 5. Policy principles 5.1. LSE offers a generous holiday entitlement to all staff. While many LSE staff successfully balance their work and personal commitments using their annual leave, it is appreciated that circumstances can arise, often unexpectedly, when employees may require additional leave to address situations outside work. There are also statutory provisions that enable indi viduals to take periods of time away from work for the fulfilment of certain public duties. 5.2. Time off under this policy may be paid or unpaid. Where provisions in this policy refer to specific paid leave entitlements, they will be pro -rated for part -time s taff. 5.3. Paid time off under this policy is not an automatic right. All requests should be considered separately, taking into account both the circumstances and operational requirements. A decision made in response to one request does not necessarily set a p recedent for future requests. Where a leave request is approved, efforts should be made by the employee and manager to ensure that any impact on operational performance and delivery is mitigated where possible. 5.4. During any period of leave taken under this policy, the employee should keep in touch with their line manager and let them know when they expect to return to work, including if anything changes to affect their return date. 5.5. The scenarios covered under this policy are not exhaustive. Where a scenari o falls outside those covered here, the employee and/or their manager can discuss the circumstances with their HR Partner and/or HR Adviser. 5.6. For all types of leave, line managers may, where there are exceptional circumstances, put forward a case for exten ded paid or unpaid leave to be provided. Cases should be in writing and sent to the Director of Human Resources (for Professional Services Staff) or to the Pro -Director Faculty Development (for Academic Staff), detailing how much leave is being requested a nd the exceptional circumstances and reasons that apply. 5.7. Leave options set out in this policy are a discretionary benefit and do not form part of the contract of employment; they may therefore be varied or changed by LSE. 6. Approval process This section sets out the approval process which should be followed for leave requests made under this policy. Where additional expectations apply to particular types of leave, these are detailed within the relevant section. 6.1. Unless stated otherwise, all leave requests made under this policy should go via the employee’s line manager. Approval is at the manager’s discretion, although they should make efforts to approve reasonable requests. 5 6.2. Employees can request a period of lea ve under this policy by completing the Special Leave Request Form and forwarding the form to their line manager, or another appropriate authoriser (e.g. if the line manager is unavailable), as far as possible in advance of the start date of the leave. In m aking and considering requests respectively, the employee and manager are encouraged to discuss the situation in an open and collaborative manner, including how any impact on service provision could be mitigated. Both the employee’s role and their personal circumstances should be taken into account in agreeing a suitable arrangement – for example, whether a disabled employee has a suitable homeworking set - up for ad -hoc or unexpected situations. Managers should consult with their HR Partner if they are unsur e about how to handle a particular request. Separate Guidance Notes for Special Leave Requests are available from HR to guide individuals through completion of the request form. 6.3. It is acknowledged that, in some cases, it may not be practicable or reason able to expect the employee to complete the Special Leave Request Form in advance of their leave (e.g. where they have experienced a shock such as a bereavement). In such cases, the arrangement, including agreed dates, should be confirmed in writing (e.g. by email) and the form may be completed at a later date. 6.4. Employees should keep their line manager updated if anything changes which is likely to affect their expected return date. In exceptional circumstances, staff may have returned to work before it is possible to contact their manager. In these instances, the employee should still inform their manager of the reason(s) for their absence when they return. Where leave is taken without either appropriate approval or reasonable efforts to notify the manager, this may be recorded as unauthorised absence; in such cases, pay will be suspended for the period of unauthorised absence and the matter may be formally investigated as a disciplinary issue. 6.5. Employees are entitled to an appropriate level of confidentiality concerning their lives outside work. Where an employee wishes to take time off under this policy, their line manager should be mindful (and, where feasible, should agree beforehand) about wh at information is shared with the team and other colleagues. Any confidential information provided through completion of the Special Leave Request Form will be shared on a strictly ‘need to know’ basis and any reporting on special leave requests (e.g. by H R) will be anonymised where possible. Types of Special Leav e 7. Compassionat e leave and bereavement s upport 7.1. LSE recognises that coping with a bereavement can be difficult and often traumatic. In the event of the death of a close relative, LSE is commit ted to supporting staff by offering and agreeing compassionate leave to support them in taking the time they need away from work. 6 7.2. LSE staff can take paid leave in the event of the death of a close relative or someone else with whom the employee had a clos e continuing relationship. Compassionate leave is an important resource for staff at a difficult time and managers should be mindful of the particular circumstances and impact on individuals when providing support. Once compassionate leave is exhausted, an nual or unpaid leave may be approved if the employee needs more time away from work. 7.3. For the purposes of both this section and policy, a ‘close relative ’ is defined as a: • Child • Parent or next or kin • Spouse or partner • Sibling • Grandparent • Parent -in-law • Someone who is a relative or close friend of the employee who is most important to them but does not fall into one of the categories above. 7.4. Compassionate leave is normally for up to two days (pro-rata for part -time staff), although line man agers may, after consultation with their HR Partner, approve a longer period of paid leave of up to 15 days, for example where: • An employee’s close relative or dependant is terminally ill or when, in the absence of other nursing arrangements, the employee is responsible for care. • An employee’s close relative or dependant is due to undergo a period of significant medical treatment, e.g. a complicated surgery. The time off does not need to be taken consecutively. If an employee is responsible for making fu neral arrangements and/or there are other extenuating circumstances (for example if the death and/or funeral is in an overseas country), a total of up to five days’ paid leave may be approved – see Time off for funerals. 7.5. An employee who wishes to take compassionate leave should notify their line manager as soon as is reasonably practicable. Employees do not have to complete a Special Leave Request Form before taking compassionate leave (although they may choose to do so) ; a brief agreement with their line manager will suffice in most cases – either through discussion or email. If their line manager is unavailable, the employee should contact another suitable individual, which could be the line manager’s manager or a nominat ed deputy. If they are unable to speak with an appropriate manager, the employee should leave a message and contact details so that the manager may then get in touch with the employee. 7.6. LSE recognises that a bereavement can affect different people in diff erent ways. Line managers have an important role to play in supporting staff, recognising that t he nature and level of support that the employee will need will vary by individual circumstances. Managers should also be prepared to be reasonably flexible in terms of when (and how) the employee returns to work, as well as signposting to relevant support as appropriate. In addition, 7 managers should be mindful that employees may require additional time off for religious or cultural reasons related to the bereave ment, for example to enable them to attend mourning rituals. 7.7. In some situations, a short -term change in working arrangements may be appropriate, such as offering flexible working to enable the employee to make a phased return to work. Throughout this per iod, line managers should be actively involved (or as actively involved as the employee indicates) in signposting to relevant support, such as the Staff Counselling Service and/or Employee Assistance Programme (EAP). Time off for funerals 7.8. Where an emplo yee requests time off to attend the funeral of a close relative, paid leave should normally be granted for the day of the funeral, in addition to any period of compassionate leave already agreed. Paid time off may also be given, where possible, to enable a n employee to attend the funeral of a close friend or work colleague. 7.9. Line managers should consider the employee’s circumstances when granting leave to attend a funeral. In particular, some employees may need to travel long distances, including travellin g overseas. In such circumstances, one or a combination of paid, unpaid and annual leave may be agreed between employee and manager (with input as required from the HR Adviser). Bereavement support 7.10. LSE has a range of resources to support employees who have experienced bereavement, including: • A Staff Counselling Service which offers both in -person and telephone appointments • An Employee Assistance Programme which can be contacted 365 days a year 7.11. External sources of help and support for bereaved employees include: • The NHS, which offers advice and support, as well as information on specialist bereavement support grou ps; • An employee’s GP; • Age UK has a website which includes guidance and support on coping with bereavement; • Marie Curie supports families living with a terminal illness; • Healthwatch has a website offering a comprehensive list of different organisations that may help those suffering bereavement. 8. Parental b ereavement leave 8.1. LSE recognises that, while coping with any bereavement is difficult, the death of a child can be particularly distressing. In the event of the loss of a child under the age of 18, employees can take parental bereavement leave under this policy. This leave may be taken in combination with other leave types, e.g. a period of compassionate leave may be followed by parental bereavement leave. In the case of a pregnancy loss or stillbirth, the period of 8 parental bereavement leave must start after the period of m aternity leave or paternity/partner’s leave has ended, but it does not have to be taken immediately after. LSE’s Maternity Policy details other support which is available. 8.2. All employees can take parental bereavement leave if they are the parent of the child who has passed away or the partner of the child’s parent. This provision also applies to employees who have pare ntal responsibility for a child, including adoptive or foster parents and step -parents. If an employee has lost more than one child, they are entitled to separate leave for each child who has passed away. 8.3. Employees can take up to two weeks of parental be reavement leave, as either: • A single block of two weeks; or • Two separate blocks of one week each. If it is more beneficial to the employee to take the leave as individual days, this can be considered by the line manager on a case -by-case basis; every effort will be made to accommodate these requests. 8.4. Employees who wish to take parental bereavement le ave should notify their line manager no later than when they are due to start work on the first day on which they wish to take leave or, if that is not feasible, as soon as possible afterward. LSE appreciates that this is an incredibly challenging time for employees. In addition to the initial period of bereavement, it is recognised that the anniversary of the death of a child can be especially difficult. For that reason, parental bereavement leave may be taken at any point within 56 weeks following the bereavement. In all cases, it is expected that the employee and line manager will work together to agree the arrangements and that the manager will actively support the employee, including signposting to bereavement support where appropriate. 8.5. A period of parental bereavement leave will normally be paid at the statutory rate, in which case the employee’s line manager should notify Payroll of the dates of any such period of leave so that appropriate adjustments can be made. 9. Dependants ’ Leave 9.1. An employee who is the main carer of a dependant can apply for reasonable time off to deal with an emergency involving that dependant. This time off might be to: • Provide assistance when a dependant falls ill, gives birth or is injured or assaulted • Make ar rangements for the provision of care for the dependant if they are ill or injured • Address the unexpected disruption or termination of arrangements for the care of the dependant, e.g. if a school or nursery closes unexpectedly • Deal with an unexpected incide nt which involves their child at school or another educational establishment 9 9.2. Managers are encouraged to be open -minded about what constitutes a ‘dependant’ under this provision – this may be an individual’s parent, partner, child or someone who lives as a family member; however, it may also be someone unrelated to the employee. Time off may also be agreed for the care of a person who is not a dependant but who relies on the employee if suddenly ill or injured, such as an elderly neighbour or friend. Manage rs can contact their HR Partner or HR Adviser if they are unsure whether dependants’ leave is appropriate in a given situation. 9.3. Staff who need to be absent must tell their line manager as soon as practicable and inform them of the reason for the absence and the estimated time they will be away from work. In some situations, it may not be possible for the employee themselves to provide advance notice of their need for time off, in which case the employee, or someone on their behalf, should notify the line manager as soon as they are reasonably able to do so. 9.4. In most circumstances, the amount of dependants’ leave will be a maximum of 1-2 days at any one time and will be paid at the employee’s normal rate of pay. Where a longer period of time away from work is required, the circumstances will be fairly considered and time away may be treated as annual or unpaid leave. 10. Domestic emergencies 10.1. Employees can take a reasonable period of paid time off work to address a genuine domestic emergency which is not covered under the other sections in this policy. Situations that might be considered a ‘domestic emergency’ include but are not limited to: • Burglary • Vehicle theft or accident • Emergency ho me repairs, e.g. arising from or to avoid flooding • Another unexpected event which reasonably requires the employee to take a brief period away from work to address the situation 10.2. If a domestic emergency occurs which is likely to require the employee to ta ke some time away from work, they should let their line manager know promptly – where possible before the employee is due to start work. 10.3. There is no set period of leave to which staff are entitled in the event of a domestic emergency, and each case shoul d be assessed and managed in line with the individual circumstances. Normally, it is anticipated that a maximum of one day will be enough for the employee to address the immediate situation and to make alternative arrangements as required, after which the employee should return to work as soon as reasonably practicable. 10.4. The provisions in this section apply to domestic emergencies that are unexpected. Where an employee knows about a situation beforehand (e.g. if maintenance work has been scheduled for thei r house), they should make appropriate arrangements with their line manager for how this time will be handled – solutions might include a temporary period of remote working for a whole week, annual or unpaid leave. 10 11. Unpaid leave 11.1. Unpaid leave is an option which may be appropriate in a range of circumstances, including many scenarios under this policy. Any LSE employee may apply for unpaid leave, regardless of their staff group or length of service. Unpaid leave may be used in conjunction with another leave arrangement as well as to cover longer, unexpected absences that are normally beyond the scope of this policy. An employee does not need to have exhausted their other leave entitlements (such as annual leave) to agree and take a period of unpaid lea ve. 11.2. Employees who wish to take a period of unpaid leave are encouraged to first discuss the situation with their line manager. Where unpaid leave is agreed to enable the employee to address a situation (or fulfil a role) outside work, the line manager sh ould notify Payroll of the dates so that appropriate adjustments can be made. 11.3. Where unpaid leave is required on a longer term or ongoing basis, the employee can request this by completing a formal Flexible Working Request Form, briefly explaining the rea sons for the leave and the period of leave requested. Further information about flexible working in general can be found in the Flexible Working Policy, which is supported by the Flexible Working Toolkit. 11.4. The following apply during a period of unpaid lea ve: • The employee’s employment is continuous, i.e. their continuous service is unaffected. • Up to one month, the employee will continue to accrue their contractual annual leave entitlement. Where the period of unpaid leave extends beyond one month, the contractual annual leave entitlement will cease during the leave period and the employee will a ccrue annual leave at the statutory rate (i.e. 28 days per annum including bank holidays, pro -rata for part -time staff). • Where unpaid leave is approved for less than two continuous weeks, there will be no implications for the employee’s pension contributi ons. However, where unpaid leave is approved for longer, LSE will not maintain paying employer contributions during the unpaid leave period. Employees should therefore contact the Pensions team in HR to discuss pension implications if they are considering applying for a period of unpaid leave of more than two weeks. 11.5. A period of unpaid leave may also be taken to enable a working parent to care or otherwise spend more time with their young child. Please see the Parental Leave Policy for more details, including the procedure for requesting and taking unpaid parental leave. 12. Volunteeri ng leave 12.1. All LSE employees are el igible to take up to five paid days per calendar year (pro -rata for part - time staff) as volunteering leave. Volunteering leave might be used for activities that ‘give back’ to a community, for learning new skills or undertaking some other work outside LSE which is beneficial to personal wellbeing. 12.2. The employee should discuss their volunteering leave request with their line manager well in advance of when they wish the leave to start. The agreed arrangement should be confirmed in 11 writing. Volunteering leave may be taken in one continuous block (which might be suitable if, for example, the employee’s role has quieter periods during the year) or as a number of different days spread over a longer time period. 12.3. Staff who wish to take volunteeri ng leave are also encouraged to complete an online form, which can be found on the Social Wellbeing webpage. While completion of the form is not requi red for approval of the leave, it is helpful to assess the take -up of this benefit. 13. Religious and cultural observance 13.1. LSE is a diverse community and as such the School recognises that some employees may need time off in relation to religious and cultural observance. This is typically anticipated to involve requests for a day off for a particular religious or cultural occa sion, although it may also be on a daily or weekly basis for a small number of staff. 13.2. All staff who need time off for religious or cultural observance are entitled to request: • Temporary flexibility in the arrangement of shifts, rotas and working hours i n general. • Leave options that may include annual leave, unpaid leave or another type of leave as agreed with their line manager. • Where a change to an employee’s hours and/or location of work as a result of religious or cultural observance is likely to be ongoing, they can choose to submit a formal flexible working request. 13.3. Managers should be sympathetic to requests related to religious and/or cultural observance, and should try to accommodate them where is it reasonably practicable to do so and where the impact on service delivery is manageable. 14. Time off to visit relatives abroad 14.1. LSE has a staff community of many nationalities. As such, it is recognised that some employees have close relatives abroad whom they may wish to visit for an extended period. 14.2. Where staff wish to visit relatives abroad, a number of different options exist for how such requests may be handled, including: • Managers may exceptionally agree to approve periods of annual leave of more than two weeks • Unpaid leave may be agreed, inclu ding in conjunction with another leave type (e.g. to follow annual leave once the latter is exhausted) • Allowing employees to work remotely for longer than normal 14.3. Where an employee wishes to stay abroad for a longer time and intends to work during at least some of that period, the Overseas Working Policy should be consulted and their line manager should contact the relevant HR Partner before the leave is approved. 12 15. Jury service 15.1. Employees who are called for jury service (or to attend court as a witness) are entitled to reaso nable paid time off to attend. Jury service is normally expected to last up to 10 working days, unless an employee is granted an exemption, but may on occasion be longer. 15.2. Staff will be paid their full salary during jury service and therefore will not nee d to claim loss of earnings from the court. During the period of jury service, if an employee is not needed at court for any day on which they would normally work, they are expected to return to work (which may include working remotely where suitable). 15.3. Staff should notify their line manager as soon as they receive notification that they are required to attend court so that, where necessary, arrangements can be made to cover their absence. The employee should provide their manager with a copy of the Court summons and any other relevant documentation. In exceptional circumstances and on a one -off basis, staff may be asked to delay their jury service if their absence is likely to have a significant detrimental impact on LSE’s operational delivery. 16. Public duties 16.1. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996, employees who hold certain public positions have a right to reasonable unpaid leave to carry out those public duties. This includes if an employee is a magistrate, member of a local authority, member of a relev ant health or education body, or certain other public roles. 16.2. Public duties under this provision might include: • Attendance at meetings of the public body, including any committees or sub -committees ; • Performance of duties approved by the public duty; • Mandatory training associated with the role. 16.3. The employee should discuss their public duties role with their line manager, where possible in advance of undertaking the role, and how much time away they are likely to need each year. New starters at LSE wh o already hold a position with a relevant public body, or employees who take up such a position, should provide written notification to their line manager. 16.4. Employees should give their line manager as much notice as possible of any public duties for which they wish to take leave. Leave requested at short notice (i.e. less than one week) may be granted but at the line manager’s discretion. 16.5. Staff who are unsure whether a particular public position qualifies for leave under this policy are encouraged to rai se this with their HR Partner. 17. Travel and weather dis ruption 13 17.1. Each employee is responsible for making appropriate arrangements to be able to work on time. If employees know that their commute is likely to be disrupted as a result of travel and/or weathe r disruption (or indeed another factor), they should raise this with their line manager as soon as possible. 17.2. Where it is not possible or reasonably practicable for an employee to travel to campus, alternative working arrangements (e.g. working remotely or taking a period of time in lieu) should be agreed between the employee and line manager. Managers responsible for shift workers or staff who, due to the nature of their role, cannot easily work remotely or take time in lieu, should plan ahead where poss ible for disruptions. 17.3. It is acknowledged that travel and/or weather disruption may on occasion affect a larger number of staff, for example as a result of: • Severe weather conditions resulting in delays or cancellations to public or private transport • Major disruption due to accidents • Industrial action affecting public transport services • Fuel crisis • Other incidents, including those involving emergency services In such events, LSE makes every effort to keep operational activities going, includ ing anticipating disruption in advance where possible and communicating advice to staff. If it is necessary to restrict access to buildings, staff will be notified as early as possible. LSE maintains a webpage which provides current business continuity news and advice for both staff and students. 17.4. Where travel or weather disrupts the employee’s location or hours of work, they may agree with their line manager to: • Work from home: while this may not be suitable for all roles, reasonable efforts should be made to accommodate it, e.g. using the time to complete relevant online training where the e mployee is unable to undertake their normal duties. • Take time off in lieu (TOIL) using hours already worked. • Agree to work the hours lost at another time. • Take annual or unpaid leave. • Request dependants’ leave if their child’s school or nursery is closed. This may also apply where the employee is in fact able to attend campus but needs to take time away to address an unexpected breakdown in childcare or other caring arrangements. 17.5. If the employee is overseas and is unable to travel home safely, they shoul d discuss with their line manager whether it is practicable for them to work remotely until they are able to travel again. 18. Armed Reserve Forces Training 18.1. LSE acknowledges that staff who are volunteer members of the Armed Reserve Forces many need to take time off each year to attend training camp. Staff should let their line manager know as early as possible when they need to take time off. Employees must provide documents to their line manager evidencing their membership and confirmed dates of the an nual camp. 14 18.2. Time off under this section may be taken as annual or unpaid leave. 18.3. Where the employee would like to adjust their work pattern to enable them to attend regular training, they may ask to do so by making a flexible working request under the Flexible Working Policy. Mobilisation 18.4. In the event that the employee is mobilised (i.e. called away for active service), the following will apply: • Mobilisation may be compulsory or voluntary. Compulsory mobilisation cannot be refused but the employee may be asked to apply for an exemption, deferral or revocation if their absence is likely to have a serious impact on operational service or delivery. Where this is the case, the application must be made within 7 days of the employee’s receipt of the mobilisation notice. Reservists are normally given at least 28 days’ notice of mobilisatio n and the period of mobilisation can range from 3 up to a maximum of 12 months. An employee who wishes to volunteer for mobilisation must seek prior agreement from their line manager. LSE is not obliged to give consent for voluntary mobilisation and line m anagers should consider any such requests within the context of the anticipated impact on the team. • Time away from LSE will normally be recorded as unpaid leave. Annual leave will not accrue during this period. Where applicable, the Ministry of Defence wi ll pay employer’s contributions to the employee’s LSE pension, subject to the employee continuing to pay their own pension contributions. LSE may apply to the MOD for an employer’s award in respect of any replacement costs that exceed the employee’s earnin gs, for any non -recurring costs (such as agency fees and advertising costs where the employee’s role has been covered by recruitment), and for any additional training needed as a result of their absence when they return to work. • Mobilisation will not cre ate a break in employment if the employee is reinstated within 6 months of demobilisation. After mobilisation, employees have the right to be reinstated to their former job within 6 months of mobilisation on terms and conditions that are no less favourable. Where this is not possible, they will be offered an alternative position with equivalent terms and conditions. The employee must write to their line manager no later than the third Monday after demobilisation confirming their intention to return within 1 3 weeks. In exceptional circumstances, this may be extended up to a maximum of a further 13 weeks. It is an offence to dismiss an employee because they have been, or are likely to be, called up for military service. 18.5. Further information about Reserve Forc es, please see the government webpage. 19. Policy imple mentation and review 19.1. This policy and its complementary resources will be promoted through the onboard process for new staff, training for managers and periodic promotion. 19.2. This policy and its accompanying EIA will be reviewed in line with HR’s policy schedule as well as any c hanges in the statutory environment. 15 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years November 2026 May 2026 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 September 201 7 JNICC Known as ‘Staff Su pport Leave Policy ’ 2 November 2023 JNICC Links Reference Link Contacts Position Name Email Notes Senior HR Policy Adviser Kieran Darling k.darling1@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': \"1 Operational Guidelines for the Professional Services Staff Spotlight Prizes and Praises 2023/24 1. Introduction The School is committed to recognising, rewarding, and celebrating the success of its staff. The following paragraphs set out the arrangements for awarding Spotlight Prizes and Praises to professional services staff in the School. 2. Aim 2.1 The School is committed to recognising and rewarding continued exceptional contribution and outstanding performance of individual members of staff towards the furtherance of the School's objectives. 2.2 These guidelines explain the nature of the Spotlight Prizes and Pra ises, their role within the wider framework of contribution payments and encourage consistency in the application of the prizes by providing clear guidance to managers and staff about criteria and process. The guidelines also include information on the monitoring mechanisms in place to ensure the payments are determined through a fair and equal process. 2.3 Spotlight Prizes are a mechanism for the School to recognise exceptional contribution and outstanding performance by professional services (PS) staff during a specific task or project. A Spotlight Praise can be used to reward staff for undertaking a cross-cutting School wide activity. 2.4 The Human Resources Division is responsible for advising managers and staff throughout the process. Line managers are responsible for a fair and consistent assessment of employee performance. 3. Broad principles 3.1 The Spotlight Prizes and Praises scheme is separate from, but complimentary to, the annual pay awards, contribution pay process and VIP Awards. It is intended to support the 2 recognition of performance and work which may be overlooked by the contribution pay process. The Spotlight Prizes and Praises scheme is designed to be more immediate, flexible and more tailored to local priorities. It aims to reward short -term achievements while the contribution pay process will continue to be used to reward sustained excellent performance that exceeds expectations. 3.2 Managers should consider all professional services staff within their area for Spotlight Prizes and Praises, whether they are on salaried or hourly paid contracts. Where managers are not as familiar with the performance of individual or groups of staff themselves, they should pro- actively seek feedback from other managers and supervisors to ensure that everyone in their area has been fairly considered, irrespective of their contract type or pay grade. 3.3 Spotlight Prizes will t ake the form of non-consolidated one-off payments of £ 3001 while Spotlight Praises are for £1001. Both will norm ally be considered for individual members of PS staff. It is also possible to submit a case for team prizes where there is clear evidence of co-operative working leading to an exceptional outcome. 3.4 The aim of the scheme is for payments to be made quickly in order to ensure that recognition is as close to the achievement as practically possible. From nomination, the aim should be for the individual to receive the relevant correspondence within one week and the lump sum processed in the next available payroll. 3.5 Senior managers should ensure that nominations are based on rational and j ustifiable performance outcomes. 3.6 Spotlight Prizes and Praises are not intended to be a reward for long service though managers will need to be alert to the claims of those whose “quiet contribution” ensures the successful delivery of departmental or divisional objectives and who may be more deserving than the more overt performer. Managers should also avoid rewarding those they know best at the expense of other staff and should make whatever enquires are necessary to make a fair overall assessment of their staff. 3.7 Managers should avoid creating a climate of expectation in this respect and any suggestion that not being recommended for a Spotlight Prize or Praise is a negative reflection on an employee’s performance. 3.8 Whilst staff are unlikely to receive repeat awards there is no prohibition on those who have worked over and above their role receiving more than one Spotlight Prize throughout their career. A Spotlight Praise can be repeated for similar activity where considered appropriate. 3.9 Staff who have resigned from the LSE and are working their notice period are not eligible to be put forward for a Spotlight Prize or receive the award they have been nominated for. A Spotlight Praise can be payable during the notice period. 3.10 Awards for staff funded from budgets other than Cash Staffing Budgets (CSB) such as self-funded areas will require funding confirmation prior to submission and the budget code should be provided. If necessary, further clarification can be obtained from the relevant Financial Planning and Analysis Manager within the Finance Division. 1 Tax and NI Contributions are payable on this payment by the individual in the usual way. 3 4. Criteria for nominating staff 4.1 Spotlight Prizes The following are criteria upon which nominations can be made for a Spotlight Prize: • Exceptional Performance - Performance that exceeds expectations in achieving agreed objectives and therefore enhances outcomes on the local operational plan. • Citizenship – Demonstrating a commitment to contributing to a healthy and happy working environment for all. • Going the Extra M ile – Showing a commitment to succeed above and beyond normal expectations. • Promoting a Positive C ulture - Responding positively and creatively towards the resolution of unexpected challenges. • Delivering E xcellence – Exceeding expectations during a project or short -term initiative. 4.2 Spotlight Praises Spotlight Praises can be used to reward staff for undertaking a cross-cutting School wide activity. An example of where a Spotlight Praise may be applicable is for staff who have volunteered to be a Fair Recruitment Adviser. 5. Process 5.1 Spotlight Prizes Line managers should send their nomination to the Service Lead or Head of Department (HoD). The nomination should specify under which criteria the nomination is being made as described in section 4.1 of the guidance. The Service Lead/HoD should review the nomination with advice from their HR Partner. Once approved, it should be sent to HR.Reward@lse.ac.uk including the following details: o Name of the nominated member(s) of staff o Name of division, department, centre or institute o Reason for the award. Managers should specify under which criteria the nomination is being made as described in the section 4.1 of the guidance o Service Lead/Head of Department approval The HR Reward T eam will inform the Chief Operating Officer of the nomination. The member of staff will receive a letter w ithin one week from the nomination being sent to the HR Reward Team with all the relevant information. The HR Reward Team will instruct payroll to make the payment and the individual will receive it in their next available pay. 5.2 Spotlight Praises These can be approved in two ways: • A Spotlight Praise for a cross-cutting School -wide activity may have been pre- agreed and will not require Service Lead or HoD approval. • Alternatively, where a line manager wishe s to nominate an individual involved in a cross -cutting School -wide activity, they should send their nomination to the Service Lead or Head of Department (HoD). The nomination should 4 include the reason for the award. The Service Lead/HoD should review the nomination with advice from their HR Partner. In such circumstances, line managers may wish to consider whether a Spotlight Prize may be more appropriate. Nominations should be sent to HR.Reward@lse.ac.uk including the following details: • Name of the nominated member(s) of staff • Name of division, department, centre or institute • Reason for the award • Service Lead/ HoD approval (if required) The member of staff will receive a letter from the HR Reward Team as soon as practical. The HR Reward T eam will instruct payroll to make the payment and the individual will receive it in their next available pay. 6. Budget Allocation 6.1 The budget for Spotlight Prizes and Praises are allocated separatel y by the Finance and Estates Committee. 7. Monitoring and issues of equity 7.1 The School is committed to monitoring and evaluating its reward procedures and activities to ensure consistency, equity and fairness. 7.2 The HR Reward Team has responsibility for maintaining information on past payments and providing relevant equality and diversity data to the Professional Services Staff Contribution Group during the Summer Term. Data will also be provided to HR Partners by the HR Reward Team t o help facilitate the consistency of approach and review the overall number of department submission s each year. 7.3 The Human Resources Management Board has responsibility for overall oversight of policy -related issues and will be provided with an appropriate analysis of the prizes (with particular attention to equality and diversity). 7.4 The Reward Team will keep the pattern of applications and prizes across and within areas under review in the context of equitable treatment and the need to promote diversity, and to ensure that there is no adverse impact or detriment to any staff group as a consequence of School policy and procedure. 7.5 An annual analysis report will be prepared by the HR Reward Team to ensure relevant stakeholders are kept informed of the application of the scheme. 7.6 These guidelines will be reviewed annually to ensure that the scheme can take into account any necessary amendments.

       "  'text': '1 1. Introduction 1.1 Sabbatical leave is fundamental to faculty development and to the pursuit of excellence in research and education (teaching and learning). The School therefore encourages eligible employees to apply. We have established the following policy and procedure t o ensure that individuals\\' exercise of the right to sabbatical leave benefits not only their own career development but also the academic community of the LSE as a whole. 1.2 This policy and procedure aims to ensure that sabbatical leave is administered fairl y and consistently and to outline the application process. 1.3 This document supersedes any previous sabbatical leave policy and procedure. 2. Eligible staff 2.1 This policy and procedure applies to the following academic (research and teaching) staff: those in the posts of Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor. It does not apply to professionally qualified staff (Senior Lecturers and Professors of Practice), research staff, teaching -only staff or professional serv ices staff. 2.2 An academic staff member who has formally indicated in writing an intention to leave the School or an intention to retire is not normally eligible for sabbatical leave. 3. Purpose of sabbatical leave Sabbatical Leave Policy and Procedure Academic 2 3.1 The purpose of sabbatical leave is to enable members of academic staff to pursue research, initiatives related to education and/or other career development activities in order to achieve objectives that have been agreed with the relevant Head(s) of Department in line with Departmental and School str ategy. Sabbatical leave releases academic staff from day -to-day teaching and administrative duties for a specified period of time. Sabbatical leave may be used for travel in connection with the purposes for which it has been granted. 4. Remuneration 4.1 The gran t of sabbatical leave normally will be without reduction of salary or supplements. Honoraria attached to office holding will only continue to be paid if the staff member continues to carry out the office during their sabbatical leave. 4.2 The purpose of sabba tical leave does not normally include enabling members of academic staff to accept a remunerated teaching engagement in term -time at another university, or to engage in other remunerative employment. While academic staff are not precluded from accepting a small commission to, for example, give one or two special lectures, they are required to obtain the permission of the Director before accepting any paid employment or undertaking any substantial amount of paid work during their sabbatical leave. Staff on s abbatical leave can continue to perform remunerated teaching at LSE (e.g., Summer school teaching, executive teaching). 5. Roles and Responsibilities 5.1 Director of the School and Pro -Director Faculty Development • By custom, authority to oversee, consider and d etermine sabbatical leave applications within the framework of the School’s approved Policy and Procedures has been delegated by Council as the School’s employing authority to the Director of the School. • The exercise of this authority has become impractical given the growth in the size of the School and the progressively increased entitlement to sabbatical leave. The authority to consider and determine sabbatical leave applications is now therefore further delegated by the Director to Heads of Department under the authority given to her or him by Council to delegate the authority delegated to her or him. Heads of Department may consult the Pro-Director Faculty Development for advice in determining sabbatic al leave applications and must do so if they propose to decline a sabbatical leave request which is eligible within the terms of the applicable regulations. • The Director remains accountable to Council for the exercise of the authority to oversee the Sabba tical Leave Policy, but may delegate this authority to the Pro -Director Faculty Development. 5.2 Heads of Department • The Head of Department is responsible for reviewing and determining requests for sabbatical leave. • Heads of Department should ensure that th e number of staff absent on any type of academic leave does not exceed what is appropriate to the Department\\'s size and needs. Adequate provisions should be put in place to cover any type of academic leave. 5.3 Academic staff 3 • Academic staff are responsible fo r submitting a request for sabbatical leave to the Head of Department. 6. Leave Periods 6.1 Sabbatical leave is given for one or more terms. Leave starts with the start date of term and ends with the start date of the following term as published by the School. In particular, those taking sabbatical leave during Summer term should be exempted from teaching and administrative duties (e.g. dissertation marking) until the start of Michaelmas term. However, staff going on sabbatical leave remain responsible for actio ns that follow on from the period before they go on sabbatical leave, e.g. the setting of an exam paper that takes place during their period of sabbatical leave. 6.2 The maximum amount of sabbatical leave that can be taken at one time is normally three terms, i.e. one year’s leave. 6.3 Members of staff taking a year\\'s leave usually commence their leave at the start of Michaelmas term. 6.4 Individuals can combine the Directorship of an Institute or Research Centre with a period of sabbatical leave if they wish. In this case, if a Director of a Research Centre/Institute applies for one term of sabbatical leave, they could take this as half- time over two terms to combine the leave with the Directorship of the Centre/Institute. 7. Timing of Sabbatical Leave, Cover of Duties a nd Replacement Teaching Arrangements 7.1 The precise timing of sabbatical leave depends on the possibility of making satisfactory arrangements for the work of those on sabbatical leave to be carried out by other colleagues as part of their work in the School. It is generally expected that collea gues will cover the duties of staff on sabbatical leave but it is accepted that the expertise of those on leave will not necessarily be replicated within the Department. In these circumstances, replacement expertise may have to be bought in and the Head of Department may request the allocation of replacement teaching funds. 7.2 Courses should not normally be suspended as a consequence of a staff member taking sabbatical leave. Heads of Department must take into account the impact on compliance with the Consum er Protection Law before requesting the suspension of a course, in particular where notice periods are less than 12 months. 7.3 In cases where approval of a sabbatical leave application will necessitate a request for temporary teaching cover, Heads of Depart ment should make a case in writing and send it to the Planning Unit, for referral to the Pro -Director Planning and Resources. Heads of Departments are advised to await the decision of the Pro -Director before giving Department endorsement to the leave app lication to ensure that funds will be available. 7.4 Where a member of academic staff applying for sabbatical leave is an academic office holder or member of a School Committee and the leave falls within the term of office/membership, the member of staff mu st indicate how these School duties will be covered during the leave. The application will not be processed by Human Resources until this question is addressed satisfactorily. 4 8. Application Process 8.1 Applications for sabbatical leave should be made on the Sab batical Leave Application Form. To aid Heads of Department with planning ahead and to integrate requests for sabbatical leave and research buy -out or unpaid leave, members of academic staff should normally give notice to their Head of Department of their i ntention to apply for sabbatical leave at least 12 months in advance of the beginning of the academic session in which the leave will occur, not the date of commencement of the leave itself. Even earlier planning is strongly encouraged. 8.2 For sabbatical lea ve requests for two terms, the Head of Department has the right to require the staff member to take one of the two terms in Summer term. 8.3 Staff applying for sabbatical leave are required to state in the application the purpose(s) for which the leave will b e used (1 -2 pages will usually suffice) – see section 3. For pursuing research, this may be a specific programme of work (e.g. completion of a book or article). For pursuing innovative initiatives in education or for other career development activities, a detailed plan of 3 pages or more is required. Staff are encouraged to seek the advice of the Teaching and Learning Centre (TLC) if the purpose of which sabbatical leave is applied for is education or other career development. 8.4 Staff based in equal parts in two Departments should seek the informal approval of both Heads of Department and the formal approval by one Head of Department. Staff predominantly based in one Department should also seek the informal approval of both Heads of Department, but the forma lly approving Head of Department must be from the Department in which they are predominantly based. 8.5 The Departmental Manager checks whether sufficient leave entitlement is in place before the Head of Department reviews and potentially approves the formal sabbatical leave form. The approved application form must be sent electronically to hr.adviser@lse.ac.uk. 9. Report of Sabbatical Leave Taken 9.1 All staff granted sabbatical leave are required to produce a brief (2 -3 pages) report, using the School’s template, on how a period of sabbatical leave has promoted the agreed purpose for which sabbatical leave was granted, indicating the benefits to their own career development and the School. 9.2 Failure to produce a satisfact ory report on sabbatical leave taken from academic session 2017/18 onwards results in further sabbatical leave applications being automatically declined until such a report has been produced since the report is taken into account in the Head of Department’ s decision to approve the sabbatical leave request. 9.3 The report should be sent electronically to the Head of Department and hr.adviser@lse.ac.uk during the term following the return from sabbatical leave. This report will be forwarded to the Pro-Director Faculty Development and kept on the staff member’s personal file in Human Resources for reference when considering future applications for sabbatical leave. 10. Sabbatical Leave Postponed or Declined 5 10.1 A member of s taff normally will be granted the sabbatical leave to which they are entitled unless the Department and/or School has strong reasons for why it should not be granted for the period for which it is requested. Examples of such reasons are too many requests f or leave, including buy-out, at any particular time. Sabbatical leave is an entitlement, but there is no entitlement to take sabbatical leave at a particular time. In such cases, sabbatical leave is postponed to a future date but not declined and the Head of Department should specify at what future date sabbatical leave is likely to be granted. Heads of Department must take into account equity considerations and postponement of sabbatical leave should not penalize those who are willing to perform important teaching or service tasks on the basis that these tasks cannot be easily taken on by others. In cases where the Head of Department postpones a sabbatical leave request that was made at least 12 months in advance of the beginning of the academic session in which the leave will occur, the member of staff can appeal to the Pro -Director Faculty Development. The member of staff and the Head of Department will be informed of the Pro - Director’s decision on the appeal and the reasons for it. The Pro -Director’s decision is final. 10.2 Heads of Department can decline to approve a sabbatical leave request if the purpose for which sabbatical leave is applied for is inconsistent with the purpose for which sabbatical leave can be taken, as specified in section 3. Likewise, re ports of past sabbatical leave taken will be taken into account to establish whether the purpose for which sabbatical leave is applied for is likely to be accomplished. Inadequately explained failure to accomplish the purpose of past sabbatical leave may r esult in future sabbatical leave being declined. The Head of Department may also grant sabbatical leave for a shorter period than applied for (in case sabbatical leave of more than one term is applied for) in order to check that the first period of leave f ulfilled its purpose before the second period of leave is granted. 10.3 A sabbatical leave request may also be postponed or declined where concerns have been raised with an individual, in writing, regarding their contributions to research, citizenship/service or teaching aspects of their contract. In such circumstances, a Head of Department may, after consultation with the Pro -Director Faculty Development, decide that certain specific improvements need to be demonstrated in these areas prior to granting a peri od of sabbatical leave. 10.4 The Head of Department must consult with the Pro -Director Faculty Development before declining a sabbatical leave request but the decision whether to approve or refuse a request lies with the Head of Department. 10.5 In cases where the Head of Department, after consulting with the Pro -Director Faculty Development, declines a sabbatical leave request, the member of staff will be informed of the reason(s) in writing and can appeal to the Director. The member of staff and the Head of Depar tment will be informed of the Director’s decision on the appeal and the reasons for it. The Director’s decision is final. 11. Calculation of Sabbatical Leave Entitlement 11.1 Entitlement to a period of sabbatical leave is calculated on the basis of qualifying service. Members of academic staff wishing to apply for sabbatical leave should first ensure that they have accrued enough service credit for the intended leave. Human R esources provides an up -to-date calculation of sabbatical entitlement at the start of each term to 6 Departments. Departments should inform their staff at the start of each academic session about their sabbatical entitlement. 11.2 Since 30 September 1978, there have been three revisions of School Regulations for Sabbatical Leave. The current calculation of qualifying service came into effect 1 October 2001 and is not retrospective. 8 terms of qualifying service provide 1 term of sabbatical leave entitlement, 16 terms of qualifying service provide 2 terms of sabbatical leave entitlement, 21 terms of qualifying service provide 3 consecutive terms of sabbatical leave entitlement. 11.3 Qualifying Service • Time spent on sabbatical leave, full- time buy -out, secondment, an d other forms of leave will not count towards sabbatical leave entitlement. Partial buy -out is disregarded pro rata. This includes buy -out paid for fully by a member of staff’s personal financial rewards from research grant income. Certain types of buy -out (e.g. for the purpose of internal secondment to take up a School leadership role) can count toward sabbatical entitlement if approved by the Pro -Director Faculty Development in advance. • Where Occupational Health Advice (OHA) confirms that a period of sick ness absence of one month or longer is the result of a disability, this will count towards sabbatical entitlement. Other periods of sickness absence that are not related to an OHA confirmed disability of one month or longer normally will not count towards sabbatical leave entitlement although individual circumstances may be considered on a case -by-case basis. • Time spent on maternity, paternity, adoption or shared parental leave will count towards sabbatical entitlement. • Time spent on additional research lea ve following maternity/paternity/adoption leave for a total period of eighteen weeks or greater or following long -term sickness absence as determined on a case -by-case basis will count towards sabbatical entitlement. • A period of continuous service at LSE a s a Temporary Assistant Professor, Associate Professor or Professor immediately prior to a career- track/open -ended appointment at LSE counts as normal School service for sabbatical purposes. In this case, the service accrued during the temporary appointme nt is added to the current service. Previous service at LSE as a member of professionally qualified staff, research staff, teaching -only staff or LSE Fellow does not count towards sabbatical entitlement. • Service at other institutions can count for computin g sabbatical leave to some extent if this has been approved at the appointment stage and must be stated in the appointment letter of the member of academic staff – see section 12. 11.4 Accrual of Service: Part -Time Staff • Part time members of staff wishing to apply for sabbatical leave need to accrue the same amount of service as full time members of staff. For example, an individual employed on a 0.5 FTE contract would need 8 terms of 0.5 FTE service in order to apply for 1 term of sabbatical leave. The sabbat ical leave would apply to the 0.5 FTE appointment with the School. 12. Carry Forward of Service from another Institution to LSE 12.1 The School appreciates that sabbatical leave can be an important factor in determining whether an individual accepts an offer of a ppointment at the School. 7 12.2 Service at another university immediately preceding service with the School can be taken into account in computing the period of service required as qualification for sabbatical leave. 12.3 The carry forward of service from another institution to LSE must be agreed at the appointment stage by the Pro -Director Faculty Development and must form part of the staff member’s appointment letter to take effect. The Head of Department must be consulte d before any agreement regarding carry forward of service is confirmed. 12.4 The Pro -Director Faculty Development, by delegated authority from the Director, has decision making authority and may agree one of the following: • Qualifying service from another university will be honoured. Normally, service in another university may be used as a top -up device and should not count on a like for like basis; • Entitlement to a sabbatical term(s) from the previous institution will be honoured; • A sabbatical leave may be taken sooner than the LSE policy regarding qualifying service prescribes (mortgaging). 13. Anticipated Service (Mortgaging) 13.1 It is possible to anticipate School service although the School does not favour this in case the individual leaves the School before the \"mortgage\" is paid off. 13.2 A “mortgage” of up to three terms of qualifying service can be approved by the Head of Department. A “mortgage” in excess of three terms of qualifying service, with the recommendation of the Head of Department, requires the approval by the Pro -Director Fac ulty Development. 14. Enhancement of Sabbatical Leave Entitlement 14.1 Various School roles and offices carry enhanced sabbatical entitlement, as determined by the Director on the advice of the Office Holders Group. This additional service credit is added to the normal service accrued by the member of staff. For example, double (triple) entitlement means that three years of service will count as six (nine) years for the purposes of calculating sabbatical entitlement, i.e. three years normal service plus an addit ional three (six) years as enhanced entitlement. 14.2 The following list provides an overview of current arrangements but these can be changed by the Director on the advice of the Office Holders Group at any point in time. School Role or Office Enhanced Pro-Directors Triple Vice -Chair of Academic Board Triple Vice -Chair of Appointments Committee Triple Heads of Department Triple Deputy Heads of Department (from 2016/17 on) Double 8 14.3 No member of academic staff can benefit from more than triple enhanced sabbatical entitlement. 14.4 Where a member of academic staff applying for sabbatical leave is an academic office holder or member of a School Committee and the leave falls within the term of office/membership, the member of staff must indicate how these School duties will be covered during the leave. The application will not be processed by Human Resources until this question is addressed satisfactorily. 15. Commutation of Enhanced Sabbatical Leave Entitlement into Cash or Personal Research Account 15.1 It is possible for enhanced sabbatical entitlement to be commuted into a cash payment or a payment into a personal research account. The value of the payment will be £7,000 for each term of sabbatical leave otherwise taken. Only sabbatical leave earned via enhanced sabbatical leave entitlement can be commuted. The maximum commutation is normally £42,000 though commuting up to this limit does not exclude the possibility of further commutation at a future point in time. 9 Appendix 1: Frequently Asked Questio ns and Answers 1.

       "  'text': '1 Introduction a) The School is committed to resolving issues related to capability performance in a consistent and timely manner and recognises that managing work performance is essential for individual, team and School success, as reflected in this policy and procedure. b) The Capability Performance Policy and Procedure is separate to the Career Development Review (CDR) process, which focuses upon employees’ personal and career development. Performance related issues should be dealt with under this policy and procedure, rat her than the CDR. c) For the purposes of this policy and procedure, ‘capability’ is defined as a lack of skill or aptitude and not a failure of will on the employee’s part to do a good job. Performance issues related to ill- health should normally be referred to the School’s Capability Health Policy and Procedure. Issues arising from alleged misconduct or gross misconduct will be more appropriately dealt with under the School’s Disciplinary and Dismissals Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff. M anagers should seek further advice from HR if they are not sure which policy and procedure should apply. Scope d) This policy and procedure applies to Professional Services Staff (PSS). e) This policy and procedure does not, however, apply to new employees du ring their review period with the School. Any such performance issues will be dealt with in accordance the School’s guidance on Review Periods procedure(s). (see Review Periods for further information). Policy aims f) The principle aim of this policy is to ensure that all employees have the opportunity and support to strive to achieve and maintain appropriate standards of job performance. T his Capability Performance Policy and Procedure for P rofessional Services Staff Operational 2 policy therefore outlines the types of support which can be discussed and agreed to aid the employee to reach the required standard of performance. As such, the focus should be upon dealing with issues at an early, informal stage wherever possible. g) The principle aim of the procedure is to provide appropriate steps for capability performance issues to be resolved as effectively as possible, supported by a fair and transparent process. h) The School encourage s managers to address issues of competency and s kills with the employee at the earliest opportunity, in order to help employees to improve their performance. The role of the manager and employee are set out in the attached procedure. Policy principles i) This policy and procedure has been drafted in compliance with the principles set out in the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures. j) This policy and procedure should be applied in a non -discriminatory way, in accordance with the Eq uality Act 2010 and the School’s commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion. Where an employee wishes to request a reasonable adjustment this should be submitted to the line manager, where appropriate, to the Chair of the meeting. k) The School encourages informal means of improvement in work performance, wherever appropriate, to resolve capability performance issues, ie. as part of normal day -to-day management or in accordance with Stage 1 of the Capability Performance Procedure for Professional Services Staff. l) There is no statutory time frame for improvements for under -performance and the timescales for improvement will depend on the individual circumstances, including the employee\\'s role, their seniority, their past performance and the severity of the performance issues at hand. In some cases, a timescale for review of a few weeks may be sufficient. In others, a timescale for review of several months may be more appropriate. The period of review will be communicated to the employee and should be long e nough to provide them with sufficient time to attempt to meet the required standard and to enable the manager to assess whether or not the employee has made and sustained the necessary improvements. m) Where informal discussions are not effective or appropriate, the School is committed to formally supporting employees on a structured basis, over a period of time, prior to any consideration of dismissal on the grounds of performance. However, it may be fair to dismiss an employee without notice of required imp rovement should the consequences of a single act lead to a total loss of confidence in the ability of the employee to do their job e.g. errors that could have put the health of others at significant risk or invalidation of a required qualification or profe ssional membership. In such instances the School’s Disciplinary and Dismissals Policy and Procedure may be more appropriate process, but advice should be sought from HR in determining the appropriate policy and procedure. 3 n) Mediation can be a useful tool in helping both to have an honest and open conversation. If, at any point during the procedure, it is felt that mediation might be of value, this could be considered in addition to the process; e.g. where the manager and individual are unable to develop a shared understanding of the performance issues. Please see Mediation for further information or contact HR for further advice. o) The Employment Rights Act 1996 states that \"capability\" is a potentially fair reason for dismissal. For the dismissal to be fair, the School must be able to show that it has treated the employee reasonably in taking the decision to dismiss. p) If you would like further in formation or advice on the Capability Performance Policy and Procedure, please contact HR. 4 Capability Performance Procedure for Professional Services Staff Roles and responsibilities a) Employees have a responsibility to: \\uf0a7 accept that their performance should reach a satisfactory level; \\uf0a7 engage with any training, development or other measures id entified to help to achieve the required level of performance; \\uf0a7 consider whether it would be helpful to advise their manager of matters, including personal, health, or disability issues, which are affecting their performance and to reflect on the impact of any non- disclosure of pertinent information. b) Managers have a responsibility to: \\uf0a7 set, communicate and provide feedback on standards of required performance as part of normal management meetings, eg. one -to-ones, CDRs; \\uf0a7 address issues of underperformance promptly maintaining confidentiality and provide appropriate guidance, support, or assistance to help the employee to improve. This procedure has three stages, outlined below. Managers should seek the advice of HR before comme ncing any stage of this procedure. Stage 1 - Informal Action for Improvement a) Managers should aim, where appropriate, to seek to address an employee’s performance by discussing the issues with the employee and providing necessary support and/or coaching, in order to mitigate the need to use the subsequent stages of this procedure. b) Action under this stage should always be a two way conversation between the line manager and employee with the primary objective of supporting the employee, for exampl e with additional training. c) There are various ways managers can support staff to improve their performance, such as, but not limited to, on -the-job training, external training, coaching, more regular meetings and recognition as and when their performance improves. The exact types of support will depend on the individual and situation. Further advice on support can be sought from HR. 5 d) Though not a requirement, if there are undisclosed matters which are preventing the employee from performing to the required standard, such as a disability or a personal issue, the employee can consider disclosing this to the manager so that any relevant support e.g. a specific piece of equipment or additional flexibility, where needed. e) This stage should take place during norm al day -to-day line management supervision. These meetings, therefore, will be between the employee and their line manager, without colleague or trade union representation or HR attendance. Employees may, of course, seek advice and support from appropriate colleagues (such as mentors, trade union representatives or staff networks) if they so wish and HR Partners are available as a point of contact and information.. f) Although this is an informal stage, the aim should be to help the employee to meet the required standard of performance in a structured way. It is important that the specific performance concern(s) are explained to the individual and e xamples of performance issues are provided as a basis for setting clear and achievable targets for improvement. In many cases, a ‘performance development plan’ (PDP) should be jointly drawn up that clearly outlines the areas for improvement, agreed objectives and given timescales for improvement. Objectives and outputs should be SMART, i.e. s pecific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time -oriented. g) Crucially, a PDP should also include the support and/or training that the employee can expect to help them receive the required improvement level, as well as the level of monitoring and supervision that can be expected. Not all cases will involve a need for coaching or training, or additional support, but in all cases the employee and manager should consider whether this is relevant. h) The PDP will allow the manager and employee to objectively track and measure whether the employee’s performance is improving adequately and should be discussed and reviewed regularly. i) Normally, this stage can be expected to last up to a maximum of three months, but this can be shortened or extended depending upon the employee’s ro le, the nature of the performance concerns and/or the number of performance issues to be addressed. j) Although it is hoped that informal resolution will avoid formal action, for the purposes of fairness and transparency, it should be made clear to the empl oyee at this stage that formal action may be necessary if there is insufficient improvement. k) If, after the informal PDP review period has concluded, the employee’s performance has improved sufficiently then no further action would be taken at that time un der this procedure and the manager will inform the employee accordingly. The manager should keep a record of the PDP and its successful outcome as part of normal supervision notes and records. However, if performance falls again, the manager will need to consider, with advice from HR, whether repeated action under the informal stage of this procedure is the appropriate course 6 of action, or whether moving to Stage 2 is more relevant. l) If, after the PDP review period has concluded, the employee’s performanc e has not improved quite to the required standard, but may do if the review period were extended, then an extension to Stage 1 can also be agreed and the above process would continue until the new agreed, shorter end date. m) If, after the PDP review period has concluded, the employee’s performance still falls short of the required areas of improvement, the following formal stages should be followed, in consultation with HR. 7 Stage 2 – Performance Management Meeting A performance management meeting will be arranged if Stage 1 is not successful. It may also be reasonable to go straight to this stage, without going through Stage 1, where capability concerns are sufficiently serious. a) The line manager will convene and lead the performance management meeting. The manager will write to the employee, providing five working days’ notice of the time, date, location of the meeting and the name of the HR representative advising on the procedure. The letter will also outline the shortfall in performance and support p rovided so far, together with any supporting documentation such as a PDP. b) The employee shall also be advised of their entitlement to be accompanied at the meeting by either a work colleague or trade union representative. The companion will be able to confer with the employee during either the Stage 2 or Stage 3 meeting, as both are deemed to be formal meetings, and will be allowed to address the meeting in order to put forward and sum up the employee\\'s case, respond on the employee\\'s behalf to any view expressed at the meeting and ask questions for clarification of any witnesses. Employees, not companions, will be required to answer direct questions put to them during the meeting. c) The circumstances of any action to be taken against a representative of a recognised trade union will be notified to a full- time trade union officer. d) Solicitors, family members and all other non -employees will be excluded from the meetings, unless there is a duty to make reasonable adjustments, e.g. for a disability. Requests in such circumstances for additional or alternative representation should b e submitted to the Chair of the meeting for consideration. However, further advice should be sought from HR in such circumstances. e) Employees are expected to attend all meetings requested of them under any stage of this procedure, irrespective of whether t hey agree or disagree with the concerns relating to their performance. Unreasonable refusals to attend, or repeated instances of failing to attend, may result in the procedure being continued in absence of the individual. f) If an employee’s chosen companio n is not available at the time proposed for the meeting, the manager should postpone to a time given by the employee provided that the alternative time is both reasonable and normally not more than five working days after the date originally proposed. If t he chosen companion is not available within this time frame, an alternative should be sought by the employee. g) The manager will be accompanied by a member of HR to provide advice on procedural matters, who may ask questions for clarification. A second mem ber of HR may also be present to take a written record of the meeting. Electronic recordings are not permitted, though employees and/or companions are welcome to take their own written notes. 8 h) The line manager will outline the purpose of the performance management meeting when it commences. Normally this meeting will: i. Provide an opportunity for the manager and employee to discuss formally the expected standard of work required; the current shortfall; and, what support and training has been given so far. ii. Provide the opportunity for the employee to discuss a relevant explanation of any unknown reasons which may be the cause(s) of the performance issue or simply to comment further. iii. Provide an opportunity for both the manager and employee to discuss the performance issue(s) formally, exploring how they may be addressed and the types of support needed. iv. Discuss and formally note how improvement in the employee’s performance will be monitored and assessed and what time scales will apply. v. Discuss and agree a reasonable review date whereby improvement in performance should be seen. The review date will usually be between one and three months, but this will depend upon the nature of the role, its seniority and the number and severity of issues to be addressed. vi. Confirmation that the employee’s performance will be monitored regularly throughout the whole period and, if the performance does not improve or is not maintained, it may be necessary to take further formal action. Further formal action could include the fo llowing stage of this procedure, at which point termination on the grounds of capability may be considered. vii. It should also be confirmed that if, in the opinion of the line manager, the employee’s performance deteriorates further during the review period, Stage 3 of this procedure may be convened before the end of the Stage 2 review date. i) After the performance management meeting, the manager will write to the employee confirming what was agreed during the meeting, namely; the performance issue(s) discuss ed; standards to be achieved, how these will be measured and by when; any agreed training and support; the possibility of progression to the next stage of the procedure if the required standard is not met and the possible outcomes of this stage. This may or may not include a structured Performance Development Plan (PDP), as under Stage 1, depending upon the breadth and depth of the performance concern(s) at hand. j) The manager and employee are jointly encouraged to regularly review and monitor progress agai nst the measures agreed in the performance management meeting and ensure that any agreed training and support commences in a timely fashion. k) If the performance improves by the deadline, the manager will write to the employee confirming this and informing the employee that Stage 1 of the procedure has been concluded. The letter should also note that their performance will continue to be monitored for a period of 12 months in order to ensure that the performance is maintained, via the usual supervisory meth ods. If the performance falls within the 12 months, Stage 2 may need to be resumed or Stage 3 may need to commence depending on the seriousness of the 9 performance issue. l) On occasion, e.g. where significant mitigating circumstances have disadvantaged the employee’s ability to improve; or there has been some improvement but not quite to the required standard, it may be possible to reconvene the performance management meeting under Stage 2, with a shorter second Stage 2 review period a likely outcome. m) If, ho wever, it is clear at the end of Stage 2 that the employee’s performance has not improved sufficiently and/or not maintained then the manager should seek the advice of HR. Normally, the manager will then inform the employee that the matter will be moving t o a Stage 3 Capability Performance Hearing, which will be usually led by the line manager’s manager or suitable peer. Stage 3 – Capability Performance Hearing n) The Capability Performance Hearing is the last stage of this procedure and will normally be chaired by the line manager’s manager or a suitable peer, with the support of a member of HR and a note taker. Employees may request tha t an alternative chair be considered by providing a reasonable explanation as to why the line manager’s manager may not be impartial, eg. if they have previously been involved in the case. o) Normally, one or all of the preceding stages of this procedure will have been followed. However, it may be necessary to go straight to this stage if the employee’s capability results in, for example, a fundamental loss of confidence, not better dealt with under the School’s Disciplinary and Dismissals Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff. p) Before the Capability Performance Hearing commences, the line manager will comple te a report outlining the case in detail which will be circulated five working days prior to the meeting. q) The employee will receive the same written notification and right to be accompanied, as noted in Stage 2. However, this letter will note that a poss ible outcome of a Capability Performance Hearing is dismissal. In addition, the line manager and employee will both be given the opportunity to provide any supporting documentation and call any witnesses, if relevant. r) At the hearing, the Chair will expla in the purpose of the meeting, introduce the attendees and outline the procedure and the role of the companion. The line manager will then present their case. The employee or companion will then be invited to respond to the performance issues. s) During the course of both presentations and at their conclusion, the Chair may question both parties for the purpose of clarification. The line manager and employee may also question the other for the purpose of clarification, when invited to by the Chair. Both the 1 manager and employee shall be given the opportunity to sum up, with the line manager’s summing up being given last. t) Witnesses may be called to support the respective cases, either during their presentation or after questioning has taken place. Witnesses m ay only be present for the period of their statements and questioning. They will be questioned first by the person who called them, then in turn by the other side, the Chair and the HR representative, if necessary. The Chair of the meeting may call further witnesses, at any stage of the meeting, for the purpose of clarification. u) The meeting will then be adjourned while the facts of the case are considered, and a decision made by the Chair. The meeting shall normally be reconvened for the decision to be gi ven orally to the employee. v) The possible outcomes of Stage 3 are: i. A further period of review; ii. redeployment within the division, department, institute, centre; iii. demotion; iv. dismissal. w) The employee should receive written notification of the outcome within, no rmally, five working days of the formal hearing; this notification shall inform the employee of their right of appeal, referring the employee to the Appeals Procedure. Dismissal a) Where an employee\\'s contract of employment is terminated as an outcome of this procedure, termination shall be with immediate effect with full contractual pay in lieu of notice and payment for annual leave accrued but not taken. Appeals and grievances a) Where a grievance is raised prior to the outcome of the Capability Performance Procedure it will normally be considered in accordance with this procedure, alongside other evidence. Employees are entitled to appeal a gainst the outcome of any of the formal stages of the Capability Performance Procedure by using the Appeals Procedure for Professional Services Staff. Where a grievance is raised after a hearing or where a decision has been made it will normally be conside red under the Appeals Procedure for Professional Services Staff. Information and advice 1 a) To ensure consistency of the application of this procedure, managers should seek the advice from HR before invoking this procedure.. HR can provide general advice to employees on procedures but not specific advice relating to individual circumstances. Should an employee need assistance to prepare for a formal meeting, advice can be sought from a trade union representative or external or ganisations such as Acas. b) Employees may also find it helpful to seek general support from a School network group. 1 Revi ew schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 2 years Sept 2020 Jun 2020 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 Sept 2018 JNCC Contacts Position Name Email Notes abc abc abc@lse.ac.uk abc Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

       "  'text': '1 1. Introduction 1.1. LSE (‘the School’) is committed to providing a safe and positive working environment, and to promoting the health, safety and wellbeing of all staff. LSE also has a duty of care towards staff and others on the School’s premises and during work -related interactions. This incl udes an approach to the misuse of alcohol and/or drugs which is proportionate to the nature of the individual circumstances, as well as appropriate support where a dependency is identified. 1.2. This policy operates on the following assumptions: 1.2.1. All staff ar e aware of their responsibilities regarding alcohol and drugs, as well as the potential consequences that can arise from misuse or abuse of such substances. 1.2.2. Staff who have a recognised alcohol or drug -related problem are encouraged to seek help, in confidence and at an early stage. 1.2.3. Where a recognised alcohol or drug problem is affecting an employee’s performance, conduct and/or general wellbeing, Alcohol and Drugs Policy and Procedure Operational 2 that the si tuation is managed in a fair, sympathetic and consistent manner. 1.3. Staff and managers should be aware of the following School resources that complement much of the content in this policy. In addition, a list of useful external links is attached as Appendix A. • The Wellness Toolkit, which provides in -depth advice and guidance to support the health and wellbeing of staff. • LSE’s in -house staff counselling services, which can be contacted by staff to discuss any problem or situation which is causing them concern or stress, including alcohol and drug problems. • The Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) which provides confidential telephone counselling on all aspects of wellbeing. • The staff wellbeing webpages which set out the full range of wellbeing resources available to staff. • The Mental Health First Aiders Network, which can provide a first point of contact for an employee experiencing problems relating to alcohol or drugs, as well as other wellbeing issues. 1.4. This policy is accompanied by an Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) which aims to identify the policy’s impact in terms of protected characteristics as well as ways in which any negative impact may be mitigated. Further details on the School’s EIA process ca n be found on the EDI webpages. 2. Policy aims This policy aims to: 2.1. Set out how LSE will meet its legal duty of care to employees on School premises and during all work -related interactions, as regards the consumption of alcohol and other substances. 3 2.2. Promote greater awareness of the ways in which alcohol and drug depend encies (and their associated risks) may impact on an individual employee and those around them. 2.3. Promote an encouraging and supporting working culture, including means for self -referral (or intervention) at an early stage of dependency. 2.4. Where an alcohol or drug problem develops (or is revealed), detail the ways in which the employee may be supported, signposted to appropriate resources and their dependency managed. 3. Policy scope 3.1. This policy and its supporting guidance apply to all LSE staff, whether salaried or hourly paid. Outside these staff groups, the School also has a duty of care to agency staff, contractors and other individuals on LSE business. 3.2. This policy may be read alongside a number of other School policies that relate to employee performance and conduct. Some of these policies cover specific staff groups; others apply across all staff. These policies are listed here alphabetically - staff and managers should refer to the most appropriate policy or policies to address a given situation. • The Academic Annex clarifies performance and conduct expectations for academic staff. • The Capability Health Policy and Pro cedure, under which certain cases where an alcohol and/or drug problem is having a long -term continuous impact on an employee’s performance and/or attendance may be addressed. • The Capability Performance Policy and Procedure clarifies the ways in which capability concerns relating to the performance of a member of professional services staff should be addressed and managed. • The Disciplinary Policy and Procedure clarifies performance and conduct expectations for professional services staff, including definitions of behaviour related to alcohol or drugs which may constitute gross misconduct. • The Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Policy sets out the process by which staff (and other members of the School community) may take formal action if they feel that they have been subject to discriminat ion, harassment or other adverse treatment. This applies to both behaviour by, and towards, employees with alcohol or other substance problems. • The Etiquette Policy for Email and other Online Communication Tools, which focuses on behaviours and etiquette when working and collaborating online. • The Grievance Policy and Procedure provides a formal mechanism for professional services staff to raise concerns, problems or complaints at work. • The Sickness Absence Procedure sets out how perio ds of sickness absence, including those related to an alcohol and/or drug problem, should be recorded and managed. 3.3. In addition, the following documents also have a bearing on expectations of staff conduct: 4 • The Dignity at Work Statement which applies to all School staff and clarifies expectations of behaviour, as well a s setting out the means by which inappropriate behaviour which falls short of bullying or harassment can be easily identified, addressed and resolved. • The Ethics Code sets out core principles for behaviour that apply across the LSE community. 3.4. Where, during a formal procedure relating to an employee’s performance or conduct, it is revealed that an alcohol and/or drug problem may b e a contributing factor, this policy should be referred to – depending upon the circumstances, this may include pausing the formal procedure so that appropriate support or information may be sought in relation to this policy. If, during a disciplinary hearing for unacceptable conduct, it becomes apparent that an alcohol or drugs problem is strongly linked to the alleged offence, the disciplinary procedure may be suspended and an offer made of referral for assessment and advice on treatment. If this offer is declined, the disciplinary procedure shall continue as normal. 4. Definiti ons 4.1. The following definitions apply for interpreting this policy and related School resources. It should be noted that conditions and dependencies may exist on a continuum in terms of the level of impact on an individual; this will likewise influence the most appropriate support for that individual. 4.2. Alcohol abuse : can generally be defined as drinking either intermittently or continually, and which interferes with a person’s health, social functioning, and/or work performance or conduct. 4.3. Alcohol dependence – also known as alcoholism or alcohol addiction – as an identified medical condition refers to the most serious form of alcohol abuse. An individual who is alcohol dependent experiences a strong and often uncontrollable desire to drink – in practice, this m eans drinking at a level that causes harm to the individual’s health. People who are becoming dependent on alcohol may notice that they need to drink more to get the same effect. 4.4. For the purposes of this policy, there is a distinction between ‘drug misus e’ and ‘drug abuse’. Drug misuse: generally refers to ‘over the counter’ pharmaceutical medications or medication on prescription by a healthcare professional. Drug abuse: refer s to the deliberate use of illegal drugs or solvents, either intermittent or continuous, which may interfere with the individual’s health and/or social functioning and/or work performance or conduct. 4.5. This policy recognises that there are circumstances whe re some drugs (e.g. medical cannabis oil) are legitimately used to help manage a range of health conditions. Such drugs will not come under the scope of this policy, although other policies may be relevant 5 depending upon the circumstances, e.g. the Disabil ity Policy where an individual requires support to manage a chronic condition. 5. Polic y responsib ilities 5.1. Employees: • Should be aware of and follow School policy (including that set out here) concerning alcohol and other substances, including that which applies to the workplace as well as other work -based interactions (e.g. work events). • Are encouraged to share information about an alcohol or drug problem at an early stage so that appropriate support may be offered. • Should notify their line manage r if prescribed medication may be having an adverse impact on their health and safety, conduct or performance. • Have a role to play by treating everyone with dignity and respect, both if they are themselves experiencing alcohol or drug problems, and/or are interacting with others who may have such problems. 5.2. Line m anagers are responsible for: • Being aware of this policy and the related resources that exist to support staff, including where an alcohol or drugs problem may be impacting upon an individual. • Incorporating discussions about wellbeing into one -to-one meetings and catch -ups with staff, including prompting employees where (for example) there has been a sudden and/or unexplained change in performance or conduct. • Spotting the signs, and taking action, where it might reasonably be ascertained that an employee may be experiencing alcohol and/or drug dependency issues, e.g. if there is a sudden and/or unexplained change in appearance. • Where an employee shares that they have an alcohol and /or drug problem, taking timely and appropriate steps, in conjunction with the HR Partner and available information (e.g. medical advice). • Escalating appropriately where, for example, criminal acts have (or are reasonably suspected to have) taken place or where health and safety has been put seriously at risk. • When organising work and/or social events (including those off School premises), ensuring that staff are aware of conduct expectations, including alcohol consumption (if relevant). • Seeking further advice in a confidential and appropriate manner (e.g. from their HR Partner ) before taking formal action in relation to an employee who has an alcohol or drug problem, e.g. before instigating a disciplinary or capability procedure. 5.3. Human Resources (HR) a re responsible for: • Providing support and advice to line managers and staff in line with this policy and related resources. 6 • Treating information shared in relation to an alcohol or drug problem confidentially and only sharing on a strictly ‘need to know’ basis. • Where an alcohol or drugs problem requires intervention, working with individuals and managers to put in place suppor tive measures and to monitor the situation as required. • Working in conjunction with line managers to seek specialist advice (such as via an Occupational Health referral) where required. 5.4. The Staff Counselling service is also available for helping and advising staff who approach them with alcohol or drug problems, and for signposting to additional support as appropriate. 5.5. In addition to the above, other members of staff – such as trade union safety representatives and staff network represen tatives - play a role towards a safe and positive working environment, as well as contributing in specific cases, e.g. a trade union representative accompanying an employee to a formal meeting held under a relevant School procedure. 5.6. The School also uses external services to provide additional support and advice which may inform the management of individual alcohol and/or drug problems (such as Occupational Health) as well as general wellbeing (such as the School’s Employee Assistance Programme). 6. Policy principles 6.1. Whilst there is no specific regulation relating to alcohol or drug use in the workplace, these come within the scope of LSE’s duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act 19741 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 19992. In addition to the School’s legal obligations as an employer, the Health and Safety at Work Act also places certain duties on employees to take reasonable care for the health and safety o f both themselves and others3. It is an implied term in all LSE contracts of employment that the School (as the employer) will take reasonable care for an employee’s health and safety. 6.2. Among other effects, alcohol and/or drug dependency can potentially result in: 6.2.1. Jeopardised health and safety for the individual and/or those around them 6.2.2. Conduct, behaviour and/or performance which falls short of what is expected. 6.2.3. Adversely affected working relationships. 6.2.4. Absenteeism and/or sickness absence. 6.2.5. Jeopardised career progression for the individual. 6.3. Alcohol and drug dependence are recognised medical problems and should be approached in a compassionate and empathetic manner. Discrimination, harassment, bullying or victimisation will not be tolerated t owards, or by, employees with alcohol or other substance 1 Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, S.2 2 Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, S.5 3 Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, S.7 7 problems and will be addressed through the School’s formal procedures. Slander and/or spreading malicious rumours about alcohol or drugs in relation to an individual (whether true or untrue) will sim ilarly be subject to formal action. 6.4. While a dependency on alcohol or any other substance does not in itself amount to a disability for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010, it is possible that an addiction or sufficiently serious dependency may qualify as a disability and would be treated as such, e.g. by providing reasonable adjustments under LSE’s Disability Policy. 6.5. This policy promotes a supportive working culture which recognises that dependency on alcohol and/or drugs can be successfully treated. It is recognised that alcohol and/or drug - related difficulties can be the result of a single occurrence or can become problematic over a longer period. The early identification of a dependency (where possible) is an important principle for the management o f all cases. 6.6. While there is no obligation for an employee with a recognised alcohol or drug problem to share this with their line manager, employees are strongly encouraged to do so at the earliest opportunity so that appropriate support can be put in pla ce. This is particularly important where an alcohol or drug problem is affecting the employee’s health and safety, performance, conduct or another aspect of their employment with LSE. 6.7. Where information is revealed or shared in relation to an employee’s a lcohol and/or drug problem, they have the same rights to confidentiality and support as they would with any other medical or psychological condition. Information relating to an alcohol or drug problem should only be shared on a strictly ‘need to know’ basis, for example where information needs to be shared for the effective implementation of agreed support measures. This may on occasion include third parties, such as Occupational Health and other medic al professionals. Where information needs to be shared in relation to a particular case, the person who initially disclosed the information should be advised what is being done. Written records relating to a n alcohol or drug problem are kept confidentially in accordance with LSE’s data protection procedures and GDPR obligations. 6.8. Alcohol and drug problems can often be secondary to (or triggered by) other events or circumstances within a person’s life. Therefore, whenever an individual’s alcohol and/or drug dependency impacts on their work or otherwise becomes a cause for concern, the School will endeavour to understand the fuller picture before taking formal action. While any employee who acknowledges an alcohol or drug problem will be treated in a compas sionate and supportive manner, employees are expected to reasonably engage with attempts by the School to support and/or manage the situation. Where help is refused and performance and/or conduct concerns remain (or worsen), the appropriate disciplinary procedure may be invoked. Conduct deemed unacceptable on School premises is also not acceptable elsewhere (including off -campus work events and remote work interactions such as virtual meetings) and may be addressed under the relevant School procedure. 7. Consumption of alcohol and other substances 8 7.1. All staff attending work functions and/or social events on School premises are expected to behave responsibly and with due concern for others, including regarding the consumption of alcohol. Guidance on calcula ting units is available on the NHS website. Line m anagers and other organisers of work -related events have a role to play in making expectations clear to staff in advance and (where necessary) repeated during the event. Such clarity is important to ensure that a ‘drinking culture’ is not encouraged and excessive consumption of alcohol does not occur. In addition, alcohol -free wine and beer is available to be ordered at LSE - catered events. 7.2. Work -related events – including but not limited to parties, dinners, quizz es, drinks after work and other social gatherings – are considered to still be within the contract of employment, even if they are not held on School premises. All staff attending such events should be aware of conduct expectations and should ensure that t heir behaviour does not have a negative impact on either working relationships or the School’s reputation with outside contacts. 7.3. Alcohol can only be consumed by employees on School premises – which include Halls of Residence – on the express authority of the relevant line manager. Where consumption of alcohol on School premises (including the School’s bar facilities) leads to unacceptable behaviour, even outside working hours, this may lead to a complaint under the relevant procedure (e.g. Disciplinary or Grievance). 7.4. The use of illegal drugs on School premises and/or at events connected with the School (such as off -campus social events) is not permitted and will typically constitute gross misconduct under School procedures. This may also result in crimi nal charges. 8. Management of absence 8.1. All absence related to an alcohol or drug problem should be recorded in line with the relevant procedure (typically the School’s Sickness Absence Procedure), including self -certification through MyView. 8.2. Where an employee’s condition constitutes a disability, any related absence should be recorded and managed separat ely from other categories of sickness absence, as set out in the Disability Policy. 8.3. Employees with alcohol and/or drug problems may need to take time away from work to attend medical appointments related to the ongoing management of their condition. Wher e possible, staff should try to arrange such appointments for the beginning or end of their normal working day. Part -time staff and shift workers should try to schedule appointments for when they are not working. In line with the School’s sickness absence procedures, such appointments are not recorded as sickness absence unless they require more than half a day away from work. In all cases, managers and employees are expected to be flexible so that relevant treatment is received and any work gaps are addres sed. 9 8.4. On occasion, an employee may undertake a longer period of absence from work which is planned and agreed in advance, e.g. to attend treatment and/or rehabilitation. Where employees anticipate the need for such arrangements, they should discuss this w ith their line manager as early as possible. 8.5. Where an employee’s absence record (including any absences related to an alcohol or drug problem ) is having a significant impact on their attendance and/or performance in their role and recommended reasonable adjustments have been explored, the Capability Health Policy and Procedure for Professional Services Staff (or equivalent procedure for other staff groups) may apply. 9. Ill health retirement 9.1. Where, as a consequence of an alcohol or drug problem, an employee’s health has deteriorated to the extent that they can no longer perform their duties, and all reasonable efforts to redesign their role or secure redeployment have been unsuccessful, retire ment on the grounds of ill health will be considered if the employee is a member of one of the School’s pension schemes. An application for ill health retirement will be referred to the HR Pensions team. All applications will need to be supported by appro priate medical reports, which individuals will be required to obtain and authorise for release to the pension scheme Trustee. In these circumstances, the School will support the employee as far as possible with their application, although it is ultimately the decision of the pension scheme Trustee whether to approve individual applications. In the event that an application is rejected, the process will revert to the relevant capability health procedure. 10. Review 10.1. This policy and its accompanying EIA will be reviewed in line with HR’s policy schedule as well as any changes in the statutory environment. 10 Alcohol an d Drugs P rocedure 1. Introduction 1.1. This procedure sets out the steps to be followed in the event that an employee shares information about an alcohol and/or drug problem, or if such information becomes known in another way (such as the result of a colleague raising a concern). The procedure also sets out the ways in which different individuals may become involved in the management of an ongoing case; while this is not intended to be overly prescriptive, it aims to ensure a level of consistency in how cases are managed. 2. Monitoring wellbeing 2.1. It is expected that line managers will monitor absence rates in their team(s) as part of their normal managerial responsibilities. Line managers should be aware that increased absence rates, or a high absence rate sustained over a period of time, may poten tially be linked to an alcohol or drug problem. At the same time, it should also be appreciated that an alcohol or drug problem may not be especially visible either in an individual’s absence record or (for example) their general demeanour. 2.2. Line managers can also keep an eye on the general wellbeing of staff by checking in with them during the working day; this may be particularly important where staff are working remotely and casual social interactions are less frequent. Such catch -ups should not be intrusive and should (where possible) be agreed in advance with the employee. 3. Sharing information about an alcohol or drugs problem 3.1. There are a number of ways in which a line manager or other relevant individual (e.g. an HR Partner) could become aware that an employee has, or may have, an alcohol and/or drug problem. However such information is obtained, it should always be treated confidentially and on a strictly ‘need to know’ basis. 3.2. While it is not obligatory to do so, employees are encouraged to share with the School if an alcohol or drug problem is affecting their performance, conduct or general wellbeing. Sharing information about personal circumstances in this way allows for the School to offer appropriate support. An admission of an alcohol or drug s problem may be difficult for an individual to make and any such sharing of information should be treated with compassion, empathy and confidentiality. 3.3. Where possible, the sharing of information should happen at an early stage. In addition to allowing a ny wellbeing concerns to be addressed as soon as possible, early sharing of information also reduces the likelihood of a formal School procedure being initiated in the event of a decline in the employee’s performance or conduct. 11 4. Confidential discussion 4.1. A manager who has concerns that an employee’s performance and/or conduct may be being impacted by an alcohol or drug problem – for example, if the employee’s appearance or conduct deteriorates without any obvious reason - may choose to raise this with the employee in an appropriate manner which respects the employee’s right to confidentiality, such as during a one -to-one meetin g. The manager may also raise the matter confidentially with a relevant HR Partner or another appropriate individual within the School. Such discussions should be approached sensitively and non -judgmentally, with the primary aim of ascertaining the impact on the employee’s wellbeing and to agree upon the best way to support the employee going forward. 4.2. Individuals who have shared that they have an alcohol and/or drugs problem should be encouraged to seek help. In addition to School resources (such as Staff Counselling and the School’s Employee Assistance Programme), advice and support can be sought from: • The individual’s General Practitioner (GP) • A specialist external organisation: Appendix A provides a list of relevant organisations and contacts (this list is not exhaustive) 5. Next steps 5.1. The next steps to be followed will depend to an extent upon the nature of the initial discussion. If medical advice is required (for example, if the reasons for the change in the employee’s performance/conduct remain unclear), the line manager in conjunction with the HR Partner may make a referral to Occupational Health, in which case the manager should advise t he employee of the reason(s) for the referral. On an ongoing basis, information and advice from specialist organisations may also provide confidential support to the employee from a distance, as well as helping to inform appropriate actions agreed between employee and manager. 5.2. While the individual’s confidentiality should be respected as far as possible, there may be occasions where it is appropriate and justifiable for such confidentiality to be superseded – typically, where there is an immediate or imm inent health and safety concern. For example, an employee who is aware that a colleague in a safety -sensitive job is, or may be, under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs should inform their line manager as soon as possible in a discrete and appropriate way. Concealment in such circumstances may not be in the best interests of the colleague in question or others, and a failure to take action could lead to negative consequences, including potential action against the School. 5.3. Where an individual does rais e concerns regarding a colleague, they should not feel under any obligation to become further involved in the matter. Also, where other colleagues are aware of an employee’s alcohol or drug problem, it may be appropriate to offer them support 12 as well. Such a situation may directly or indirectly impact on others, e.g. there may be feelings of concern or resentment, or the situation may have personal resonance for others and have a triggering effect. Managers should be aware of and should signpost to appropri ate resources (such as Staff Counselling or the Employee Assistance Programme) as required. 5.4. If, at any time, the line manager believes that the law has been breached or infringed and/or that serious harm may result to the individual or another person, th ey should immediately seek advice from their HR Partner. Depending upon the individual circumstances, appropriate actions may also include contacting the police and/or other emergency services. 5.5. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for the employe e to be absent from work for an agreed period of time. The duration and nature of this absence will depend upon the details of the individual case. Absence for treatment and/or rehabilitation should be agreed by both the line manager and HR Partner; such a bsence will normally be counted as sickness absence and should be regarded as such under the School’s sickness absence procedure, including for the purposes of absence triggers. It is acknowledged that relapses may occur and that successful treatment may r equire the employee to be away from work for more than one period. Return to work after a successful treatment period should be to the same job where reasonably practicable. 13 Appendi x A: External resources A wide range of resources exist to support and inform the management of alcohol and drug dependencies. The following is an alphabetical summary of some of these key resources. While this list is accurate at the time of writing, it is not (and is not intend ed to be) exhaustive and these external resources should complement, rather than replace, supportive discussions between staff and managers. Adfam is a national charit y working with families affected by drugs and alcohol. Adfam operates an online message board and a database of local support groups. Al-Anon Family Groups provid e support to anyone whose life is, or has been, affected by someone else’s drinking, regardless of whether that person is still drinking or not. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a free self -help group. AA’s ’12 step’ programme involves getting sober with the help of regular support groups. Carers Trust includes guidance and contact organisations for individuals who caring for someone with alcohol or substance misuse issues. Drinkaware provides a lcohol -related information and support Frank provides n ational confidential drugs advice, including email, tex t, telephone and live chat functions. Mind on ‘recreational drugs and alcohol’ : this U K charity provides g uidance on recreational drugs and alcohol, including mental health effects and suggestions of where to find support. The National Association for Children of Alcoholics (Nacoa) provides a free, confidential telephone and email helpline for children of alcohol -dependent parents and others concerned about their welfare. Narcotics Anonymous : a free service which includes meetings across the UK and supports members to achieve and maintain a drug -free recovery and lifestyle. NHS webpages include guidance as to what constitutes alcohol misuse, an overview of risks and a summary of treatment options. Similar guidance exists for individuals seeking help for drug addiction. SMART Recovery groups help people decide whether they have a problem with addictive behaviour, build up their motivation to change, and offer a set of proven tools and techniques to support recovery. We Are With You is a UK -wide treatment agency that helps individuals, families and communities manage the effects of drug and alcohol misuse. 14 Appendix B: Alcohol and Drugs Policy Flowchart 15 Review schedule Review interval Next review due by Next review start 3 years November 2026 May 2026 Version history Version Date Approved by Notes 1 July 2 019 JNICC 2 November 2023 JNICC Links Reference Link Contacts Position Name Email Notes Senior HR Policy Adviser Kieran Darling k.darling1@lse.ac.uk Communications and Training Will this document be publicised through Internal Communications?

We accordingly recognise that circumstances can arise where staff may need to commute cross -border while working at the School. This Policy relates to individuals who normally commute to the UK from their main residence overseas and would be identified as either a ‘frontier worker’ or a ‘cross -border worker’. It seeks to provide clarity on the supports the School makes available to these individuals and to set out the procedures which are now needed given in particular the UK’s departure from the EU and related changes to free movement. This Policy does not relate to any circumstances where an employee is requesting to work overseas for a temporary period (and not returning to the UK on a weekly/regular basis for work) and intends to return to their normal pattern of working in the UK after the temporary period has ended. 2. Definitions i) For the purpose of this Policy you are a frontier worker if: • you are employed at LSE and • you are an EEA national • you normally travel at least once a week to LSE from an EU Member State1, and • you commenced your commuting arrangement prior to 31 December 2020, under Freedom of Movement legislation. For example, an EEA national who has commuted from their main residence in France to the UK to teach at LSE each Monday to Thursday during term -time since 1 September 2019 would be considered as a frontier worker. ii) For the purpose of this Policy, you are a cross -border w orker if you are employed at LSE and you are either: • a national of an EU Member State and you commenced your commuting arrangement after 1 January 2021 and after Freedom of Movement ended, or • you normall y travel at least once a week to LSE from a non- UK country. For example, an individual (of any nationality) who wishes to start a commuting arrangement from their main residence to teach at LSE each week during term -time from 1 January 2021 would be 1 This may be during term time for academic and teaching staff. Operational LSE Policy for Staff on UK contracts requesting arrangements as frontier workers or cross -border workers  2 considered as a cross -border worker. 3. Aims This Policy aims to outline the School’s principles and position surrounding those occasions where Staff either work as frontier workers or request to work as cross -border workers. It also aims to outline the guiding principles for Staff and Managers when requests for cross -border working arrangements need to be made (whether for a short or long term period) and the support available to Staff in this circumstance. The Policy therefore outlines the key considerations for Staff working under such arrangements and aims to guide LSE Management in considering how to proceed with requests for cross -border working with guidance from HR Partners. It is important to distinguish frontier and cross -border working arrangements from working abroad on a permanent basis. 4. Scope This Policy relates to all salaried Staff in professional services, academic, teaching and research staff groups whether on a short term or long- term fixed contract or a permanent or open -ended contract wit h the LSE and who are either currently a frontier worker or who wish to be considered as a cross -border worker, as per the definitions in Section 2. It also recognises that frontier working (and cross -border working) may not be possible in many roles, in cluding those that involve shift patterns or may cover weekend working on a regular basis. As noted above, this Policy does not include any circumstances where an employee is requesting to work overseas temporarily. Information about the new UK Frontier Worker Permit applicable for those Staff who are already working under a frontier worker arrangement before 31 December 2020, can be found in Section 6.1 below. 5. Principles The LSE campus in London is at the heart of all activities and its community. It is the hub from which the School operates, and which is part of its identity for many students, visitors, collaborators and partners, bringing together global academics, researchers and policy makers. All Staff are expected to make a full range of contribution to the campus community. In addition, academic staff contribute towards research, education and citizenship and are expected to attend the School where necessary to carr y out their contractual duties (subject to public health restrictions). These duties include teaching, office hours, School and departmental meetings, student community activities, and other in person academic support meetings. The expected main location and place of work is set out in all LSE offer of appointment letters and/or terms and conditions which are governed by the laws of the UK. It is not possible for LSE to employ Staff on a permanent basis where the intention is that their formal work locatio n is permanently abroad, based on a personal request. Such arrangements do exist on an exceptional basis for a small number of Staff (e.g. IGC Country based contracts) but do require complex arrangements including setting up a presence in the country, a localised pay administrator to comply with local taxation, and tailored pension and benefits arrangements. It would not be practical nor economical for this to be an option for Staff on UK contracts. However, the School understands and recognises that, given their personal circumstances, some staff living in EEA countries have been working as frontier workers prior to 31 December 2020 and wish to continue to do so, and that others may wish to become cross -border workers. Under this Policy, LSE acknowledges t he current status of Staff operating under frontier working arrangements and provides advice in this regard.  3 The Policy also sets out the procedure under which the School will accept and support individual personal requests for cross -border working arr angements2 (where the individual seeks approval from LSE before making such arrangements and / or notifies LSE of their arrangement as well as regularly keeping the School updated on their circumstances and where less than significant working time is spen t in the country in which they are resident if that country is not the UK). As regards such cross -border working requests, both the School and the individual will have to consider the relevant immigration, tax and welfare legislation and the individual will incur the cost of the relevant legal advice. The decision to accept such a cross -border working request rests solely with the School. It should be noted that the School will not be able to bear any of the additional cost that arises to the employee and the School as a result of the individual choosing for personal reasons to reside outside the UK whilst employed by LSE. All Line Managers are responsible for respecting the Policy and its principles and they must seek guidance from their HR Partner and Finance team before agreeing to any arrangement taking place, even if they support the request. 6. Immigration implications of a frontier w orker or cross -border worker arrangement You will need to be aware that there may be some implications on your immigration status of undertaking a frontier working or a cross -border working arrangement, depending on your circumstances, which you will need to consider, before making any changes to your working pattern. Irish nationals Irish nationals are allowed to travel freely under the Common Travel Agreement, and so if you are an Irish national then undertaking a frontier or cross -border working ar rangement will not affect your immigration status in the UK. Therefore, you will not need to take any further action regarding your immigration status, however you will still need to take legal advice on the tax and welfare implications as set out in sect ion 6.3 before making any changes to your working pattern. EU/EEA Nationals (EU Settlement Scheme) If you are currently living in the UK and you hold either pre- settled or settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, then you already have the right to live and work in the UK. You would not normally in these circumstances being applying for frontier worker status. However, if you apply for a frontier worker permit because your circumstances were such prior to the 31 December 2020, and you believe you would be granted such a permit, you should be aware that any pre- settled or settled status granted to you will effectively be cancelled. A frontier worker is an individual who lives in another country to where they work, and you can therefore not have settled or pre -settled status simultaneously to being a frontier worker. This means that if you wish to return to the UK to live in the future, then you will need to apply for a work visa. You may wish to seek independent immigration advice before making an application for a Frontier Worker Permit, if such circumstances apply to you. Frontier Worker Permit The Frontier Worker Permit was created by the UK government to protect the rights of those who live abroad as their main residence and commute to the UK f or work purposes under Freedom of 2 No School approval requirements apply to frontier work arrangements but such Staff are required to ensure that their immigration status allows them to work in the UK – see section 6  4 Movement legislation when Freedom of Movement ended on 31 December 2020. Therefore, if you live abroad and you wish to continue to commute to the UK for work purposes, you will need to apply for a Frontier Worker Permit. You will need to apply for your Frontier Worker Permit in ample time as you will need to present it at the border when you travel with effect from 1 July 2021. You are asked to advise your HR Partner that you have obtained your Frontier Worker Permit to ensure that records are kept up - to-date. Once you have your Frontier Worker Permit, you will be able to retain your status in the event of any of the following: • you are temporarily unable to work due to illness or an accident; • you are temporarily unable t o work due to pregnancy or recent childbirth; or • you are on maternity or paternity leave, and will return to previous employment or find another job after that leave. If you have recently joined LSE, you may have gained frontier worker status under your previous employment which you wish to maintain. If so, please contact your HR Adviser who will be able to advise you on your position. 6.1 Requests for frontier worker arrangements If you met the criteria of a frontier worker as set out in Section 2, then you will continue to be considered as a frontier worker after 1 January 2021 and you are not required to make a request to continue such an arrangement (section 9 does not accordingly apply). In any case, and as noted above in section 6, you will need to consider the implications to your immigration and residency status in the UK before committing to any changes in your working pattern. This means that as long as your frontier working arrangement was in place before 31 December 2020 (in that you were engaging in such an activity; no formal School approval was or is required) you will be able to continue that arrangement, providing you can demonstrate you have right to work in the UK. If you do not meet the frontier worker criteria, and you wish to work cross -border, then the School has put in place a process for considering requests for cross -border worker status which you must follow (section 9). 6.2. Request s for cross -border worker arrangements If you wish to request a cross -border working arrangement after 1 January 2021 you would need to ensure that the UK continues to be your main residence and that you do not lose your right to live and work in the UK. In these cases, the School as part of its normal processes would always need to consider your individual circumstances to ascertain whether your immigration status would allow the arrangement. If you need a visa to work in the UK, consideration would be given to which visa options are available and the implications of your proposed working arrangement before making a decision. 6.3. Taxation and Welfare implications for frontier worker and cross- border worker arrangements Tax arrangements for frontier workers and cross -border workers are subject to bilateral agreements between UK and other countries that exist to avoid double taxation. This is a complex area, and we encourage staff to seek advice, where necessary, about the implications for them personally.  5 The general rule laid down in the OECD model for a person resident in one State but working in another is that taxation applies in the State where they work. However, the specific provisions concerning cross -border workers in bilateral double taxation treaties usually grant the right of taxation to the State of residence rather than the State of the place of work. The proportion of time worked in the UK and the country of residence over the course of the year must be considered in detail and may lead to res idence for tax purposes outside the UK which could lead to tax obligations for the School and/or employee in the country of residence3. In some cases, the School may not need to register for tax deduction at source unless it has a permanent establishment in that country – meaning that the obligation for tax registration may fall on the employee rather than the School. Due to the complicated nature of bilateral tax conventions which are often superseded by local tax rules, there is a need to seek speciali st advice for confirmation 4. Mutual agreement procedure: Not all countries follow the statement of the OECD, which leads to countries having different approaches to the taxation of cross -border workers and it is necessary for the individual to obtain adv ice on these in both countries. Social Security: For working arrangements that commence on or after 1 January 2021, cross - border working between the UK and EU Member States will be governed by the EU -UK Trade and Cooperation agreement, which includes a pr otocol on Social Security Coordination (the Protocol). Under the Protocol a multi -state worker is an individual who normally works in the UK but is also in one or more EU or EEA jurisdictions for at least 5% of their working time. If an employee is deemed to be a multi -state worker, they may be liable to social security contributions in the jurisdiction in which they are habitually resident, if at least 25% of their working time is spent in that jurisdiction. It is important to seek specialist advice via the Finance Team to determine whether the School is liable to social security contributions in that other jurisdiction. The School may be required to register a non- resident entity with the local authorities, set up local payroll and pay employees and empl oyer’s contributions there. The costs for registering and operating payroll overseas can be significant. The School will look to seek reimbursement from the employee for any additional costs incurred from social security contributions, subject to it being legally compliant with the rules in that country. Additionally, staff should be aware that not being resident in the UK for tax purposes may potentially preclude you from being a member of the School’s pension schemes. If you have any questions with regards to your School pension arrangements, please contact HR.Pensions@lse.ac.uk. 7. Legal advice, and other implications of a frontier worker and cross- border worker arrangement Due to the tax and welfare implications of frontier or cross -border working arrangements, you will need to ensure that you seek appropriate legal advice for your particular circumstances before making any changes to your working pattern. You will also need to seek advice on social security, statutory benefits and local public health guidance. Often working more than 25% in the country of residence will mean that you are subject to local social security arrangements. Professional advice mus t be sought on the requirements 3 https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=bc2604e8- ad56- 4b4a -a045- 6a761db69111 4 Income received by the employee from the employer will in principle be attributed to the place where the employment relationship is exercised (the UK) and this principle is mirrored in several double tax treaties (DTT), which define the countries' taxation rights as related to the employee's physical presence when performing the activities for which the employment income is paid.  6 for your working arrangements to ensure you and your family can access local healthcare and other benefits. If you are working from your home country, the income that you receive would in principle be attributable to your country of residence.4 In addition, you are expected to take responsibility for ensuring you have the necessary technology and arrangements in place to enable you to work effectively. You must accept that you are working from abroad at your own risk and that the School will not be liable for any loss you may suffer due to your request being approved. You must also comply with all applicable public health guidance in both the country from which you travel and in the UK. 8. Costs of legal advice In all cases, you are strongly recommended to take legal advice on the implications of any current frontier or potential cross -border working arrangements. In the case of a request to undertake a cross- border working arrangement, the School will r equire that, before any request can be considered and/or approved by the School, you confirm that you either have taken, or do not believe you need, personal legal advice. This is to ensure that you are fully advised on the implications of your individual circumstances. In addition, it will be necessary for the LSE and the relevant department or division to obtain local legal advice to support current frontier workers, or before it can agree to cross -border working arrangements. In these cases, the School ’s legal costs will be borne as follows: 1. For employees who have been working on a frontier working arrangement prior to 31 December 2021 or, if they are joining the School after 31 December 2020, can demonstrate they had a frontier working arrangement in place with their previous employer: In these cases, the School will [on notification that the employee has obtained/has applied for a Frontier Worker Permit] obtain and fund the necessary advice on the employee’s circumstances, including the costs of any additional steps required to ensure LSE is compliant with relevant legislation. As noted above, employees will need to seek and meet the cost of their own legal advice. 2. Employees who request a new cross -border working arrangement: In these cases, the School will need to obtain legal advice on its position and obligations prior to the employee moving abroad. The School will not be able to fund these additional costs, as these will be incurred by the School in seeking to examine the i mplications for the School of a choice made by the employee. The employee will therefore need to obtain and meet the cost of their own legal advice, and also that of the School’s legal advice before a cross -border working arrangement can be considered. The arrangements for repaying the costs to the School will be confirmed to you separately. As part of School’s attempt to support staff to the greatest extent possible, we have procured the services of external specialists to provide advice on the tax and w elfare implications of current frontier or potential cross -border working arrangements. This is available for you to use if you wish, though you will need to bear the associated costs of seeking the advice where applicable in accordance with the above. 9. Procedure for cross- border worker arrangement requests The School recognises that the personal circumstances of its Staff may change. You may accordingly request that the School agree to a cross -border working arrangement. Such requests will only be considered if:  7 • your role can be performed effectively remotely and • can be done lawfully from the country in question and • the new arrangements would not adversely affect your right to work in the UK. Requests are generally more likely to be approved for a short, time -limited duration where your expected return date is clearly documented. The School is concerned to accommodate individuals’ reasonable requests and changed personal circumstances but, given business needs and legal requirements, reminds Staff that requests will usually be approved on an exceptional basis only. In the first instance, you are required to talk, in good time, to your Line Manager about your request to make arrangements for cross -border working. You should, at least [X] weeks in advance of your proposed change to your current arrangements, set out the nature of your request, how it will benefit you and how it will benefit the School, and how you plan to meet your commitments to the School. Your Line Manager, in consultation with the relevant HR Partner, should assess the individual case. If the case is supported, a business case should be drafted by the Line Manager for approval by the Director of Human Resources and Chief Financial Officer. The business case should include the advantages to the School of agreeing to the cross -border working request, any skill shortages in the employment market, and the willingness of the individual to meet the cost of advice on taxation and including advice on social security, statutory benefits and local public health guidance. Any necessary independent personal financial advice and advice on social security, statutory benefits and local public health guidance (and legal advice as noted above) (for the St aff member) and relevant advice for the School, must be sought in advance. LSE Finance Division will advise and all associated legal costs will be met as set out in accordance with Section 8 of this Policy before plans can be made or agreed locally with managers. Individuals must keep the School up to date on their personal circumstances should this have significant changes that affect their arrangements. The employee will be liable for any additional taxes or employee social security which may be char ged because of their decision to work for a short period in an overseas location. In circumstances where applicable the employee will be asked to reimburse the School for any additional employer contributions. The terms of any approval of a cross -border working arrangement must be agreed in advance with LSE Finance and HR and recorded in writing. You should not make any arrangements or plans for cross -border working until a signed agreement is in place. Any arrangement will be compliant with the relevant legislation pertaining to your circumstances and the country you plan to be resident in. For the avoidance of doubt, this approval procedure does not apply to frontier workers. 10. Options and outcome of requests If your request for cross -border work ing arrangements is approved, then you will have the arrangement confirmed in writing, and it would be subject to the provision that such arrangements could change in the future due to legislative or tax and welfare changes.

       "  'text': '1 1. Introduction The School has a clear commitment to the promotion of equality of opportunity for all employees. It works towards positively supporting employees who are working parents and has attained a reputation as a top employer for working families. This policy demo nstrates a commitment on the part of the School to enable employees to manage work and family. As part of this commitment, shared parental leave and pay is available to all eligible employees within the diverse School community, including LGBT+, same -sex f amilies and those involved in a surrogacy arrangement. The policy uses the following key terms: • mother: the individual who gives birth to a child or the adopter (the adopter means the person who is eligible for adoption leave and/or pay, regardless of th eir sexual orientation or gender identity). • partner: the child’s biological father or the partner of the mother/adopter. This can be a spouse, civil partner; or a partner who is living in an enduring relationship with the mother and the child. Partners m ay be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non -binary identity). 2. Policy aims The School seeks to sustain a strong track record as a diverse, fair and flexible employer that attracts and retains high calibre talent, and supports the career progression of employees during their employment by the School. 3. Policy principles Legislation on Shared Parental Leave 1. The Parental Leave Regulations 2014 result in a new legal entitlement for eligible parents of babies due, or children placed for adoption, on or after 5 April 2015. Shared Parental Leave (SPL), which replaces Additional Paternity Leave, allows eligible par ents additional flexibility in the way they choose to care for a child’s first year of life. 2. The mother will continue to be entitled to ordinary and additional maternity / adoption leave but will also be entitled to end their leave and any associated sta tutory maternity maternity/adoption pay. Policy on Shared Parental Leave Operational 2 3. SPL enables parents to share the caring responsibilities evenly or have one parent taking the main caring role, depending on their preferences and circumstances. Unlike maternity/adoption leave, eligible employees can stop and start their SPL and return to work between periods of leave with each eligible parent able to submit three notices to book periods of leave. Shared Parental Leave SPL can be used alongside, or instead of, Maternity or Adoption Leave. 4. The amou nt of SPL available is calculated using the mother’s entitlement to maternity/adoption leave, which allows them to take up to 52 weeks’ leave. A birth mother must take at least two weeks’ maternity leave following the birth of a child but can otherwise cho ose to end their maternity leave at any stage. An adopter can end their adoption leave once they have taken it for two weeks. The mother and father (or same sex partner) will then be able to share the remaining 50 weeks between them by taking the leave in turns, in different blocks, or at the same time. 5. Parents will remain entitled to take maternity, paternity and adoption leave. However, an eligible mother may now choose to reduce their maternity/adoption leave early and opt in to SPL. 6. If an employee retu rns to work immediately after a period of SPL which, together with any period of maternity/adoption leave, was 26 weeks or less they will be entitled to return to work in the same job. If an employee returns to work from a period of SPL which, together wit h any period of maternity/adoption leave, was more than 26 weeks they have the right to return to the same job or another suitable job if that is not reasonably practicable. Eligibility for Shared Parental Leave 7. A parent seeking to take Shared Parental Le ave (SPL) must have worked for the same employer for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks at the end of the 15th week before the week in which the child is due (or at the week in which an adopter was notified of having been matched with a child or adop tion) and be still employed in the first week that SPL is to be taken. 8. The other parent must have worked for 26 weeks in the 66 weeks leading up to the due date and have earned above the maternity allowance threshold in 13 of the 66 weeks. 9. The criteria fo r the employment and earnings test means that the partner could be self - employed or no longer employed provided that the earnings threshold is met and/or continuous service of 26 weeks was met before the end of employment. As a non -employee, such a partner would not be able to take the SPL themselves but the eligible partner would be able to take the leave; for example, a mother may prefer to opt for SPL rather than maternity leave because of being able to take the leave in a more flexible way i.e. in more than one block. 10. There is no increase in SPL entitlement in the case of multiple births / matching. Continuous and Discontinuous Leave SPL may be taken at any time within the period which begins on the date of birth or placement of the child and ends 52 weeks after that date. 11. An employee who is eligible for SPL can give their manager notice of a period of leave in either a single block or discontinuous periods of leave which must be taken before either the child’s birthday, or before the first anniversar y of the adoption placement. Discontinuous leave is a period of SPL of at least a block of one week, followed by a return to work, and followed by another period of SPL of at least a block of one week. 12. All notices for a continuous period of leave, from eligible employees, will be accepted. All requests for discontinuous leave will be considered. A manager can refuse the request for 3 discontinuous leave and require the employee to withdraw the request or take the leave in a continuous block. Alternatively, t he manager can propose alternative dates. The employee can take three separate blocks of leave provided that eight weeks’ notice is given before each period. Notification Requirements 13. Both parents need to notify their respective employers on how they intend to divide the period of SPL. The written notice of intention, which must be submitted at least eight weeks before the leave is due to start must contain the following information: • their partner’s name • maternity leave start and end dates • the total a mount of SPL and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) available and how much they and their partner intend to take • confirmation that they are sharing childcare responsibility with their partner and include a signed declaration from the partner stating: • their name, address and National Insurance number • that they satisfy the qualifying requirements for their partner to take SPL and receive ShPP • that they agree to their partner taking SPL and receiving ShPP. 14. After receiving the above information, the manag er can ask for the name and address of their partner’s employer, and a copy of the child’s birth certificate or in the case of adoption, documentary evidence of the name and address of the adoption agency, the date of notification of the dates of matching with the child and placing of the child for adoption. 15. Requests to vary a period of SPL (either the start or end date) can be submitted as long as the request is requested at least 8 weeks before the original start or end date. 16. The notice given to end the maternity / adoption leave is usually binding unless it becomes apparent that neither parent is entitled to SPL, or the notice was given before the birth / placement and is revoked within 6 weeks of the birth / placement. 17. After receiving notification of t he intention to take SPL, the manager may, within 14 days, request a copy of the child’s birth certificate or in the case of adoption, evidence confirming the name and address of the adoption agency and the dates of matching and placing the child. The empl oyee has a further 14 days to provide the information. Eligibility for Statutory Shared Parental Pay 18. To qualify for Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) the employee, as well as having the appropriate continuity of service (employment by the employer for at least 26 weeks at the 15th week before the child’s due/matching date and still an employee in the first week of SPL) must also have earned an average salary of the lower earnings limit or more for the 8 weeks prior to the 15th week before the child’s d ue date or placement. 19. A maximum of 39 weeks’ ShPP is payable, reduced by the number of the weeks of the statutory maternity / adoption pay already received by the mother. 20. ShPP is a standard weekly rate or 90% of the employee’s weekly earnings, whichever is the lower. The rates are reviewed every April. Information on the current rates is available on: www.gov.uk/maternity -paternity -calculator. 4 21. If the employee’s employment comes to an end during the period of entitlement of ShPP then any remaining weeks will usually be payable unless they start working for someone else. Eligibility for Contractual S hared Parental Pay 22. As part of the School’s positive support of employees who are working parents, Contractual Shared Parental Pay is available for eligible employees. Subject to qualifying for SPL and ShPP, an employee is eligible for up to a maximum of 1 6 weeks on full pay, this is not in addition to payment of ShPP or Contractual Maternity Pay. 23. A maximum of 16 weeks’ contractual ShPP is only payable during the 37 weeks in which statutory shared parental leave pay is available. 24. Two employees who are the mother and partner respectively of the same child will be eligible, subject to qualifying for SPL and ShPP, to a maximum of 32 weeks on full pay between them, this is not in addition to payment of ShPP or Contractual Maternity Pay. Shared Parental Leave i n Touch (SPLiT) Days 25. Each parent entitled to SPL or ShPP will have an individual entitlement to Shared Parental Leave in Touch (SPLiT) days for the purpose of attending training or working up to 20 days, either continuously or on odd days, without bringin g to an end their SPL or ShPP. The SPLiT days are in addition to the 10 ‘keeping in touch’ days available during maternity / adoption leave. Pension 26. SPL does not break continuity of employment for pension purposes. If return to work takes place after a pe riod of unpaid SPL, then, in line with pension scheme rules employees have the option of making pension contributions to cover the period of unpaid leave. Contingency fund for SPL replacement 27. In 1996/97 a contingency fund was set up to help departments that cannot easily meet the full cost of maternity/paternity leave replacement. Applications for funding to assist with any additional costs required to enable a department to recruit replacement staff to cover SPL should be made by managers to the APRC th rough the Planning Officer. The Academic Planning and Resources Committee (APRC) will assess each application for assistance from the fund on its merits. Research Leave, New Academic Career Structure 28. Employees who are employed under the terms and conditions of the New Academic Career are entitled to a period of research leave (i.e. 4 months) following SPL for a period of 18 weeks or more in total in order to re -establish their research trajectory. Abse nces of less than 18 weeks will not normally attract research leave. More information can be found on: https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/resLea.pdf 5 4. Further information and advice 29. The Procedure on Shared Parental Leave provides information on the steps that employees need to take to put the policy into operation. 30. Advice on eligibility for SPL can be s ought from the HR Departmental Advisory Team and HR Partners. Advice on eligibility and the amount payable for ShPP and Contractual Shared Parental Pay can be sought from the Pay Team, Finance Division. Information on the impact of SPL on pensions can be s ought from the Pensions Team. Procedure on Shared Parental Leave Introduction 1. The procedure provides information on the steps necessary to apply the Policy on Shared Parental Leave to the School’s eligible employees. The policy provides information on eligibility for Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) respectively. 2. The procedure uses the following key terms: • mother: is the individual who gives birth to a child or the adopter (the adopter means the person who is eligible fo r adoption leave and/or pay. They can be male or female). • partner: is the child’s biological father or the partner of the mother/adopter. This can be a spouse, civil partner; or a partner who is living in an enduring relationship with the mother and the ch ild. • Partners may be male, female or trans (including individuals of a non -binary identity). Entitlement to SPL and ShPP 3. If a mother takes 51 weeks or more of the 52 weeks of maternity or adoption leave available, then no shared parental leave can be cr eated. It is only the untaken balance of the maternity/adoption leave that can be taken as shared parental leave. 4. Where an eligible mother curtails their maternity leave before the end of the 52 weeks to which they are entitled, the balance of untaken ma ternity leave may be taken by them, an eligible partner or both as shared parental leave. The same arrangement applies to an eligible adopter who curtails their adoption leave before the 52 weeks’ entitlement. Maternity leave cannot be brought to an end un til after the two week compulsory maternity leave period and a minimum of 8 weeks’ notice has to be given to bring maternity leave to an end. All SPL must be taken before the child’s first birthday or the first anniversary of the date of placement in adopt ion cases. 6 5. A maximum amount of 37 weeks of ShPP can be created. The available ShPP is calculated by deducting the number of weeks’ maternity pay the mother has received on their return to work from the maximum of 39 weeks’ ShPP payable. Where a mother ta kes the full 39 weeks of statutory maternity or adoption pay or maternity allowance, then there is no untaken pay or allowance and no statutory shared parental pay can be created. Notice requirements for SPL 6. The notices that the parents must give to the relevant employer to be able to take shared parental leave are made up of three elements. They are: i. a maternity leave curtailment notice from the mother setting out when they propose to end their maternity leave (unless the mother has already returned to work from maternity leave); ii. ii. a notice of entitlement and intention from the employee giving an initial, non -binding indication of each period of shared parental leave that they are requesting; and iii. a period of leave notice from the employee setting out the start and end dates of each period of shared parental leave that they are requesting. Mother’s Curtailment Notice 7. Before the mother or partner can take shared parental leave, the mother must either return to work before the end of their maternity leave (by giving the required eight weeks\\' notice of their planned return) or provide their employer with a binding materni ty leave curtailment notice. The maternity leave curtailment notice must be in writing and state the date on which maternity leave is to end. That date must be: i. after the compulsory maternity leave period, which is the two weeks [or four weeks for factor y workers] after birth ii. ii. at least eight weeks after the date on which the mother gave the maternity leave curtailment notice to their employer iii. at least one week before what would be the end of the additional maternity leave period. 8. The mother must provide their maternity leave curtailment notice at the same time they provide either their notice of entitlement and intention or a declaration of consent and entitlement signed by the mother confirming that their partner has given their e mployer a notice of entitlement and intention to take SPL. 9. The mother can withdraw their notice curtailing their maternity leave in limited circumstances. The withdrawal of a maternity leave curtailment notice must be in writing and can be given only if the mother has not returned to work. The mother can withdraw their maternity leave curtailment notice if: • it is discovered that neither the mother nor the partner are entitled to shared parental leave or statutory shared parental pay and the mother withdr aws their maternity leave curtailment notice within eight weeks of the date on which the notice was given, or • the maternity leave curtailment notice was given before the birth of the child and the mother withdraws their maternity leave curtailment notice w ithin six weeks of the child\\'s birth, or 7 Notice of Entitlement and intention to take SPL 10. The employee, whether the mother or the partner, must provide the employer with a non -binding notice of entitlement and intention. The employee\\'s notice of entitleme nt and intention, which must be in writing and provided at least 8 weeks before the start date of the first period of shared parental leave to be taken by the employee, must set out the following information. 11. If the employee is the mother, the notice of entitlement and intention must set out: • the mother\\'s name • the partner\\'s name • the start and end dates of any statutory maternity leave taken or to be taken by the mother • the total amount of shared parental leave available • the child\\'s expected week of birth and the child\\'s date of birth (although, if the child has not yet been born, the date of birth can be provided as soon as reasonably practicable after birth, and before the first period of shared parental leave to be taken by the mother) • how much sha red parental leave the mother and partner each intend to take and • a non -binding indication as to when the employee intends to take shared parental leave (including the start and end dates for each period of leave). 12. The mother\\'s notice of entitlement and intention must include a declaration signed by them that: • they satisfy, or will satisfy, the eligibility requirements to take shared parental leave • the information they give in the notice of entitlement and intention is accurate and • they will immediately inform the organisation if they cease to care for the child. In addition, the mother\\'s notice of entitlement and intention must include a declaration signed by their partner: • specifying the partner\\'s name, address, and national insurance number (o r declaring that the partner does not have a national insurance number) • declaring that the partner satisfies, or will satisfy, the conditions for eligibility to parental leave • declaring that the partner is the father of the child, or is married to, the civil partner of, or the partner of, the mother • declaring that the partner consents to the amount of leave that the mother intends to take and • declaring that the partner consents to the mother\\'s employer processing the information in the partner\\'s declar ation. 13. If the employee is the partner, the partner\\'s notice of entitlement and intention must set out: 8 • the partner\\'s name • the mother\\'s name • the start and end dates of any periods of statutory maternity leave, statutory maternity pay or maternity allowa nce taken or to be taken by the mother • the total amount of shared parental leave available • the child\\'s expected week of birth and the child\\'s date of birth (although, if the child has not yet been born, the date of birth can be provided as soon as reason ably practicable after birth, and before the first period of shared parental leave to be taken by the partner) • how much shared parental leave the partner and mother each intend to take and • a non -binding indication as to when the partner intends to take sh ared parental leave (including the start and end dates for each period of leave). 14. The partner\\'s notice of entitlement and intention must include a declaration signed by the partner that: • they satisfy, or will satisfy, the eligibility requirements to take shared parental leave • the information given by the partner in the notice of entitlement and intention is accurate and • they will immediately inform the organisation if they cease to care for the child or if the mother informs them that they no longer meet the requirement to have curtailed their maternity leave or pay period. 15. In addition, the partner\\'s notice of entitlement and intention must include a declaration signed by the mother: • specifying the mother\\'s name, address, and national insurance number (or declaring that the mother does not have a national insurance number) • declaring that the mother satisfies, or will satisfy, the conditions for eligibility to share parental leave and they will notify the partner if they no longer qualify for maternity leave, statutory maternity pay or maternity allowance • declaring that the mother consents to the amount of leave that the partner intends to take • declaring that they will immediately info rm the employee if they no longer meet the requirement to have curtailed their maternity leave or pay period and • declaring that the mother consents to the partner\\'s employer processing the information in the mother\\'s declaration. 16. Within 14 days of receiving a notice of entitlement and intention from the employee, whether the mother or partner, the School can request from the employee: • a copy of the child\\'s birth certificate (or, if the child has not been born, a copy of the birth certificate within 14 da ys of the birth - if the birth certificate has yet to be issued after this period, a signed declaration stating the date and location of the child\\'s birth will suffice) and • the name and address of the other parent\\'s employer (or a declaration that the oth er parent has no employer). 9 The employee has 14 days from the date of the request to send the organisation the required information. 17. The employee can vary or cancel their proposed shared parental leave dates following the submission of a notice of entitlement and intention, provided that they provide the School with a written notice. The written notice must contain: • an indication as t o when the employee intends to take shared parental leave (including the start and end dates for each period of leave); • details of any periods of shared parental leave that have been notified through a period of leave notice; • details of any periods of sta tutory shared parental pay that have been notified in relation to periods where shared parental leave was not to be taken; and • a declaration signed by the mother and the partner that they agree to the variation. • Any indication of leave intended to be take n that the employee provides in a variation of notice of entitlement and intention is non -binding until they provide a period of leave notice in relation to that period of leave. Period of Leave Notice 18. To take a period of shared parental leave, the employ ee must provide the School with a written notice setting out the start and end dates of each period of shared parental leave requested in that notice. 19. A period of leave notice must be given not less than eight weeks before the start date of the first per iod of shared parental leave requested in the notice. The notice may be given at the same time as a notice of entitlement and intention and can be a request for a continuous period of leave or discontinuous periods of leave. 20. The employee can vary or canc el their proposed shared parental leave dates following the submission of a period of leave notice, provided that they provide their School with a written notice not less than eight weeks before any period of leave varied or cancelled by the notice is due to commence. The written notice can: • vary the start date or the end date of any period of shared parental leave or cancel a request for leave; • request that a continuous period of leave become discontinuous periods of leave; or • request that discontinuous periods of leave become a continuous period of leave. 21. The employee can provide a combined total of up to three period of leave notices or variations of period of leave notices per pregnancy/child. 22. If the employee submits a period of leave notice requesting one continuous period of leave, they will be entitled to take that period of leave. The employee may submit a period of leave notice requesting discontinuous periods of leave. If the employee subm its a period of leave notice requesting discontinuous periods of leave, the organisation, in the two weeks beginning with the date the period of leave notice was given, can: 1 • consent to the pattern of leave requested or • propose an alternative pattern of l eave or • refuse the pattern of leave requested. 23. Each request for discontinuous leave will be considered on a case -by-case basis. All requests for discontinuous leave will be carefully considered, weighing up the potential benefits to the employee and to the School against any adverse impact to the School; the manager may arrange a meeting to discuss the practicality of the request. Agreeing to one request will not set a precedent or create the right for another employee to be granted a similar pattern of SPL. 24. If a discontinuous leave pattern is refused then the employee may withdraw the request without detriment on or before the 15th day after the notification was given; or may take the total number of weeks in the notice in a single continuous block. If the employee chooses to take the leave in a single continuous block, the employee has until the 19th day from the date the original notification was given to choose when they want the leave period to begin. The leave cannot start sooner than eight weeks f rom the date the original notification was submitted. If the employee does not choose a start date then the leave will begin on the first leave date requested in the original notification. 25. If agreement to discontinuous leave is reached within those two w eeks, the employee is entitled to take the leave on the dates agreed. 26. A notice for discontinuous leave that has been withdrawn before it is agreed does not count towards the total number of requests for leave that an employee can make. Shared Parental Le ave in Touch (SPLIT) days 27. An employee can agree to work for the School or, for example attend training, for up to 20 days during SPL without bringing their period of SPL to an end or impacting on their right to claim ShPP for that week. These are known as \"Shared Parental Leave In Touch\" or \"SPLIT\" days. Any work carried out on a day or part of a day shall constitute a day\\'s work for these purposes. 28. The School has no right to require the employee to carry out any work, and is under no obligation to offer the employee any work, during the employee’s SPL. Any work undertaken is a matter for agreement between the School and the employee. 29. An employee ta king a SPLIT day will receive full pay for any day worked. If a SPLIT day occurs during a week when the employee is receiving ShPP, this will be effectively ‘topped up’ so that the individual receives full pay for the day in question. Any SPLIT days worked do not extend the period of SPL. 30. An employee, with the agreement of the School, may use SPLIT days to work part of a week during SPL. The School and the employee may use SPLIT days to effect a gradual return to work by the employee towards the end of a long period of SPL or to trial a possible flexible working pattern. Contract of Employment 1 31. During the period of SPL, the employee\\'s contract of employment continues in force and they are entitled to receive all their contractual benefits, except for salar y. In particular, contractual annual leave entitlement will continue to accrue. 32. Pension contributions will continue to be made during any period when the employee is receiving ShPP but not during any period of unpaid SPL. Employee contributions will be b ased on actual pay, while the School’s contributions will be based on the salary that the employee would have received had they not been taking SPL. Should the employee wish, they can make additional contributions for their period of unpaid leave upon retu rning and if they decide to do this, the School will contribute Employer contributions for this period. Contact during Shared Parental Leave 33. Before an employee\\'s SPL begins, the line manager and the employee should discuss the arrangements for keeping in touch during the leave and how the employee’s holiday accrual, whilst on SPL, could be taken. The School reserves the right in any event to maintain reasonable contact with the employee from time to time during their SPL. This may be to discuss the employe e\\'s plans to return to work, to ensure the individual is aware of any possible promotion opportunities, to discuss any special arrangements to be made or training to be given to ease their return to work or simply to update them on developments at work dur ing their absence. Returning to work after Shared Parental Leave 34. The employee will have been formally advised in writing by the School of the end date of any period of SPL. The employee is expected to return on the next working day after this date, unless they notify the School otherwise. If they are unable to attend work due to sickness or injury, the normal arrangements for sickness absence will apply. In any other case, late return without prior authorisation will be treated as unauthorised absence. 35. If the employee wishes to return to work earlier than the expected return date, they may provide a written notice to vary the leave and must give the School at least eight weeks’ notice of their date of early return. This will count as one of the employee’s notifications. If they have already used their 3 notifications to book and/or vary leave then the manager does not have to accept the notice to return early but may do if it is considered to be reasonably practicable to do so. Research Leave, New Academi c Career Structure 36. Employees who are employed under the terms and conditions of the New Academic Career are entitled to a period of research leave (i.e. 4 months) following SPL for a period of 18 weeks or more in total in order to re -establish their resea rch trajectory. Absences of less than 18 weeks will not normally attract research leave. More information can be found on https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/Policies -and- procedures/Assets/Documents/resLea.pdf Advice 37. An employee considering/taking SPL is encouraged to contact their HR Advisor or HR Partner to arrange an informal discussion as early as possible regarding their potential entitlement to SPL, to talk about their plans and to enable the manager to support t hem. In terms of ShPP, the employee is advised to contact the Head of Payroll or Payroll Manager. 38. The HR Partner may upon receiving a notification of entitlement to take SPL seek to arrange an informal discussion with the employee to talk about their int entions and how they currently 1 expect to use their SPL entitlement. Also, it may be useful to discuss requests for annual leave accrued during paid service and/or flexible working.

       "  'text': '  2 Introduction Supporting the principles laid out in the LSE Ethics Code, the Effective Behaviours Framework sets out examples of the kinds of behaviours that are expected of all colleagues in the School. The principles of the LSE Ethics Code are: • Responsibility and accountability • Integrity • Intellectual Freedom • Equality of Respect and Opportunity • Collegiality • Sustainability The effective behaviours are intended to bring to life the principles of the Ethics Code but they are not an exhaustive list. The framework is designed to support: • Recruitment - it will help those involved with selection to have a clear understanding of the behaviours that are required for a role. • Learning and development - the core course programme has been aligned to the framework with each course showing which Effective Behaviour the course supports and at which level. • Career Development Review - The behaviours have been integrated into the Career Development Review (CDR) process. • Annual Performance Review – the behaviours can be used to support the academic Annual Performance Review (APR) process. • Ways of working – effective collaborative working in all situations on campus or off campus, including blended working. At the start of any of the above activities, you need to be clear about which of the behaviours are most relevant and key to the role. Each Division, Academic Unit and Centre in the School should identify for themselves behaviours that are important to deliver the code in the work that they do, whether that is teaching, research or administration.  3 Examples of Effective Behaviours Responsibility and accountability • Understanding your role and helping others do the same • Taking personal responsibility for your working style, actions and decisions • Accepting, or appropria tely delegating, responsibility • Empowering others to take personal responsibility • Taking ownership of problems and resolving them • Managing your workload in a suitable working style and environment • Making effective use of time and meeting deadlines • Maintaining a healthy work -life balance for yourself and others • Supporting consultation and collective deliberations • Raising concerns relating t o ethical matters as they arise • Acting in accordance with and actively promoting the Ethics Code principles • Challenging or reporting inappropriate attitudes, language and behavio ur that is abusive, aggressive or discriminatory • Taking accountability for agreeing and meeting outcomes Integrity • Accepting and demonstrating personal responsibility for adhering to any relevant legislation, such as the Equality Act 2010, health and safety and data protection • Declaring and managing interests and possible conflicts • Being transparent and consistent in decision making • Setting clear, effective and ambitious objectives for your own development and for others and being respons ive to the needs of the post • Being clear about where you can be flexible and where you cannot, and why • Resolving problems quickly in a constructive, friendly manner • Asking for, accepting and acting on individual feedback, and learning from it • Managing your own reaction when faced with challenging situations • Engaging positively with the School’s processes • Keeping up to date with what is happening in your professional area • Appropriately challenging, and where necessary escalating, unacceptable be haviour by any member of the LSE community. Intellectual Freedom • Upholding the School’s commitment to academic and intellectual freedom • Upholding the freedom to research and convey research findings • Upholding the School’s commitment to freedom of speech • Defending others against infringements to their right to speak Equality of Respect and Opportunity • Fostering an inclusive environment which values equality of opportunity and diversity • Acknowledging and respecting a broad range of social, cultural and perso nal beliefs and values within the law • Demonstrating mutual respect, open -mindedness and transparency • Respecting others different working approaches and preferences • Embedding inclusive practices through the School’s policies and procedures • Actively encour aging the exchange of views and opinions  4 • Ensuring equitable access to development opportunities for all • Engaging with legislation relating to equality and diversity • Engaging with School initiatives relating to equity, diversity and inclusion • Understand ing the importance of power structures, dynamics and status (whether explicit or implicit) and not abusing privilege Collegiality • Engaging and collaborating with colleagues on research, education, knowledge exchange and impact, and professional development • Coordinating across areas, Departments and Divisions to minimise duplication • Empathetically l istening to and engaging with others to properly understand their needs • Giving colleagues advice, support and help when they need it, especially during periods of setback and change • Taking an active interest in School -wide activities and developments • Contributing to the governance of the School • Being well prepared for in-person, virtual or hybrid meetings and presentations • Regularly giving and receiving constructive feedback • Coaching and mentoring others • Using delegation as an opportunity to develop others • Encouraging others to learn from mistakes without blame • Taking time to celebrate successes and give praise • Sharing and celebrating success stories • Ensuring your communication is clear and transparent in all medium s • Identify ing and us ing appropriate communication mechanisms and style to fit the needs of the audienc e and working environment. Sustainability • Supporting the objectives of the School’s Sustainability Strategic Plan : o Embedding sustainability across our teaching and learning experiences o Shaping the global sustainability debate through our research o Deepening public discussion on sustainability across the world o Making sustainability a key part of our investment decisions o Working in partnerships within LSE and externally o Reachi ng Net Zero Carbon and reducing our environmental impacts • Reducing your use of resources (energy, water, paper, etc). • Adopting a ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’ hierarchy of options for waste. • Attending and organising meetings and events online to reduce our travel impacts. • Using low -carbon modes of transport for necessary travel (e.g. bike, rail over air). • Buying goods and services responsibly and sustainability: ➢ Locally sourced (e.g. made in the UK), long -lasting, and energy efficient. ➢ Made of recycled materi als, and recyclable at end of life. ➢ Environmentally certified products (e.g. FSC wood, Fairtrade, EU Ecolabel, B Corp) • Supporting School sustainability initiatives (e.g. Green Impact, Education for Sustainability).

       "  'text': '1 1. Statement of Policy 1.1 The School believes that staff should, wherever possible, be permitted to continue working for as long as they wish to do so provided that they are making a full and high level contribution to the School. Of course for academic staff it also wishes to see a good mix of experience with the opportunity for academics elsewhere, in for example the early stages of their career, being able to join and contribute to LSE. 1.2 The requirement that all staff should perform to the requirements set out in their cont ract, to the requirements of their role, at a level appropriate to their band and in accordance with their terms and conditions, applies, of course, throughout their careers. 1.3 This policy has been developed for use by Heads of Departments/Heads of Service/Research Centre Directors to help them in their discussions with staff about their employment options and how these might align with the needs of the Department/Division and/or the School. This policy is set in the context that the UK has no national default retirement age and the desire for the School to provide flexible retirement arrangements in accordance with the provision afforded by the School’s pension providers and through any other working time arrangements that may be offered at a School level. Retirement Policy Operational 2 1.4 Universities in the UK have generally provided good Occupational Pension Schemes. These have a determined age for full pension known as the Normal Pension Age (NPA). The School can no longer assume, however, that staff will retire at a set age. The School undertakes to ensure that for academic staff it can and does balance the needs for employees to work beyond the NPA with a requirement for the School to encourage new talent. LSE will continue to monitor its experience to ensure this continues to be the case out with the imposition of a mandatory School retirement age. 2. Retirement Planning 2.1 Whilst staff will continue working beyond the NPA, unless they take action to bring about their retirement, it is reasonable for the School to seek to understand the working intentions of staff towards the later stages of their careers in order to facilita te workforce planning and in respect of budgeting and other administrative considerations. It is also helpful for staff themselves to take stock and to consider the options open to them, particularly in the light of pension taxation limits and their possib le impact on retirement decisions. This reflection process is an ongoing one at all stages of an individual’s career and the appropriate academic review (i.e. Career Development Review (CDR) or Annual Performance Review (APR)) discussions are generally the appropriate vehicles for career academics to hold these conversations (and CDRs for other staff). These discussions assume greater importance as staff approach pension age since the staff members will have more options available to them. 2.2 The School therefore encourages staff to have open discussions with their Head of Department1/Head of Service/Research Centre Directors as early as possible in their planning for retirement. Similarly, it is reasonable for these Heads to seek to clarify the intention s of staff in the light of local and/or School operational requirements. Such discussions could cover: • arrangements for retirement; • intended retirement date; • succession and handover plans • pension details, including any transition to retirement and/or an y reduction in hours if applicable. It is important that the impact on the department/service division/research centre of any proposed changes is fully considered and assessed. Staff should be made aware that the flexible options outlined below are at t he School’s discretion and subject to formal approval (by the Pro -Director for Faculty Development, in the case of Academics and Research staff and by the Director of HR for all other staff categories). 2.3 It is also recognised that individual intentions to retire can change for a variety of reasons and that the timing of retirement is a matter of individual choice. Staff can be reassured, therefore, that retirement actions will only be initiated once formal notice to resign in writing has been received o r an agreement is reached and approved by the employer as part of a flexible retirement proposal for full retirement at a future date. 1 For career academics, the CDR/APR may be carried out by an Academic other than the HoD. 3 3. Academic Staff 3.1 In the case of academic staff, the position can be more complex as individuals whose careers may have a number of different facets discuss, in conjunction with their Heads of Department, how their careers might best be taken forward to the mutual benefit of themselves and the School in this particular phase. Research prowess, teaching aptitude and str ength in citizenship and service within the School will vary from individual to individual and will have been explored and identified as part of the ongoing performance management structures within the School. It may well be that, in addition to moving to a less than full time role, staff wish to focus their energies in areas that play to their particular strengths. The aim of such discussions is to explore ways in which individual preferences can be accommodated alongside departmental needs; the latter wil l necessarily have to be satisfied if successful outcomes are to be achieved. 4. Retirement Planning Meetings For all staff it is recommended that, at age 62, they be invited by their Head of Department /Head of Service/Research Centre Director to attend the first in a series of meetings. HR will provide the Heads with a list of staff reaching age 62 and over on an annual basis to help facilitate this. At these meetings, there should be a formal exploration about possible future plans. This may well result in an understanding that no change is proposed but there should at least be agreement about the next decision point at which to continue the discussion. These conversations can be revisited each year (or any other agreed timeline between the parties) and/or can be added to the CDR or APR as appropriate. The latter will involve a discussion with the HoD (or an explicit “delegate”). The aim of this process is to establish a framework within which a mutually beneficial career plan can be put in place. 5. Flexible Options For Transition to Retirement 5.1 Staff at whatever stage of their working life may wish to change their working pattern to suit their individual circumstances. It may therefore be possible to agree a flexible working approach, outlined bel ow. The School understands that a staff member’s employment can be affected by lifestyle preferences, personal aspirations, health considerations and changes to individual circumstances, and that the availability of flexible employment arrangements can be particularly helpful in assisting a staff member to transition towards a full retirement. Depending on an individual’s circumstances, including such aspects as pension taxation, ‘a ‘phased retirement’ may be their preference. 5.1.1 Heads of Department/Heads of Service will consider any budgetary and operational implications of any request made by staff. Staff should note that the School would be unlikely to approve any request under these arrangements that would create persistent bud getary and/or operational constraints or problems for the department concerned. 5.2 The School provides the following discretionary options to staff when considering, preparing for, and entering into, retirement. These are subject to agreement by the Hea d of Department/Head of Service/Research Centre Directors (who will give full weight to the School’s operational and business needs) and, subsequently by the Pro -Director for Faculty Development, and the Director of Human Resources for all remaining staff categories. In both cases the Pro -Director, Planning and Resources will also approve the decisions. These options can be considered on an indefinite period or for a fixed period (normally for no less than 12 4 months). Flexible Retirement options will be linked to a confirmed retirement date. They are also subject to contract variation as appropriate. 5.2.1 Reduced Hours – linked to Flexible Retirement This is a reduction in the hours worked but involves the same or very nearly the same job responsibilities. Agreement is reached locally about what work is undertaken during the proposed part -time commitment as well as the pattern of working hours which, depending on the job responsibilities, could be regular or intermittent to suit the departmental needs. S alary payments and other benefits will be pro -rated and this arrangement would involve an agreement as to a future retirement date. This is known as transition to retirement. 5.2.2 Project Work (usually of short duration) This would typically involve an offer of a fixed -term contract to undertake and complete a specified project / piece of work. The change to project work would provide a discrete piece of work prior to full retirement. The terms & conditions of employment would be appropriate to the speci fic work undertaken. 5.2.3 Flexible or Variable Work Hours Changes to the daily start/finish times and/or the days of the week on which work is carried out can be mutually agreed. However, serious consideration needs to be given to any potential impact on the health and wellbeing of the staff member, and to ensuring the required number of breaks and the requirements of the Working Time Regulations, as well as the impact on services and other staff. 5.2.4 Job-Sharing A reduction from full time to part -time working involving two people sharing the total job role and working hours of a full- time position. For more information see http://www.lse.ac.uk/int ranet/staff/humanResources/Flexible -Working/Flexible -Working.aspx (Flexible working pages). 5.2.5 Leave with/without pay Staff may find it useful to consider taking periods / blocks of time away from work at the School to explore or develop post -retire ment pursuits. Further information on the formal schemes in the School can be accessed at http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/staff/huma nResources/reviewingAndRewarding/leave/acade micStaffLeave/Home.aspx (Academic Staff leave) or http://www.lse.ac.uk/int ranet/staff/humanResources/reviewingAndRewarding/leave/staffSu pportLeave/staffSupportLeave.aspx (Support Staff leave). 6. Notification Process 6.1 Any member of staff who wishes to retire will be required to resign in writing from their post providing at least the notice specified in their contract of employment (see table below). Staff are, however, encouraged to provide as much notice as possible. Contract Type Band Minimum Notice Required Academic Support (and Research Assistants) 1-5 4 weeks 6 and above 3 months Academic Staff 7 and above (&NAC By 30th April for resignation 5 grades) effective 30th September Research Only 6 and above 3 months Teaching Only (LSE Fellows) 5 and above Up to 3 months (dependant on band). 6.2 Any such request should be made in writing and addressed to the appropriate Head of Department/Head of Service/Research Centre Director (or to the person named in their contract of employment, if different) with a copy to the pensions team in Human Resources. Upon receipt of any such resignation proposal, Human Resources will acknowledge receipt and confirm acceptance of the request to retire by reason of resignation. The member of staff’s employment will be terminated by reason of resignation (retirement) in the normal way. 6.3 A member of staff who is retiring will often have considerable knowledge in relation to his/her role and responsibilities. The School may require their assistance and cooperation for handover and for succession planning. This could include: providing detai ls of the status of work projects and future plans; developing an updated job description and person specification for the role; ensuring a smooth handover of work and assisting in training any successor. Clearly, these processes benefit from there being a s much notice as possible of the intent to retire. 6.4 Any member of staff who plans to request a flexible option to work should submit any such request to their Head of Department/Head of Service/Research Centre Director no later than 12 months prior to any proposed commencement of any such flexible option and may wish to request indicative quotations from the pensions team in advance of making this application. 7. Pensions 7.1 The School’s pension schemes (USS and SAUL) retain an age range within whic h pension benefits can be accessed and are payable. The calculation of these benefits will vary depending on the age at which they are accessed. 7.2 Staff considering retirement will wish to consider how certain options may affect their retirement benefi ts. Within USS, for example, staff from age 55 (subject to the agreement of the School) are able to opt to continue to work part time and to take part of their pension (under the USS flexible retirement provisions). They can opt to do so twice before takin g full retirement, so for example could reduce from 1fte to 0.8fte, and then later to 0.6fte, accessing a proportion of their pension benefits at each reduction in hours. Staff require the consent of the School to take flexible retirement and must indicate their intentions regarding further retirement plans as a part of this process. It should be noted that staff who take up this option before their normal pension age may be subject to an early retirement reduction, depending on their individual circumstanc es. Full details of these arrangements can be found on the USS website or requested from the LSE pension team. 7.3 Staff who are members of one of the School’s pension schemes should contact the Pensions team in HR ideally at least 3 months prior to th eir planned retirement date, or their date for varying their contract. The Pensions team will provide any pension estimates/information to assist staff with their retirement planning on an entirely confidential basis. 8. Emeritus Status 6 8.1 For Academic S taff at Professorial level there is the opportunity to seek emeritus status on retirement.

       "  'text': '1 Emeritus Status Emeritus status is conferred automatically on all full Professors, Professorial Research Fellows, Professorial Lecturers and Professors in Practice upon full retirement, subject to them having been employed at the LSE for a minimum of four years. In the remainder of this policy, the term Emeritus Professor will be used to refer to these different statuses. When referring to their association with the School, however, colleagues are required to use their full titles, i.e.: Emeritus Professor, Emeritus Prof essorial Research Fellow, Emeritus Professorial Lecturer and Emeritus Professor in Practice. Where colleagues prefer, they may use the term Emerita in place of Emeritus. These titles will come into effect on the first day after the relevant staff member’ s contract end date, following retirement. Emeritus titles are conferred in perpetuity. A committee comprising the four academic Pro Directors and the Vice Chair of the Appointments Committee may confer Emeritus status on members of academic staff who, a t the point of retirement, have not attained Professorial status, e.g., an Associate Professor may be given the title Emeritus Associate Professor. There is no remuneration attached to Emeritus status. For further details on retirement from the School, please see the Retirement Policy. Active Emeritus Status In order to retain active Emeritus status, which comes with the entitlements listed below, colleagues will be required to opt -in once per year. This will enable the School to maintain an accurate list of active Emeritus Professors, e.g., for the purposes of licensing agreements, communications, building access, etc. Emeritus Professors who become inactive will be welcome to opt back into active status at any time. Please note that the entitlements for active Emeritus Professors listed below are discretionary and may be subject to change. Emeritus Policy Academic 2 Research Support On a discretionary basis, active Emeritus Professors will be awarded an annual research allowance of £3000 per annu m for the first three years after full retirement, to be administered by their Department, Institute or Centre. They will be entitled to full support from LSE Research and Innovation with respect to their ongoing research activities. This includes assista nce with research grant applications and research grant management. They will also be entitled to full support from LSE Consulting with respect to LSE -related consulting activities and from LSE Innovation with respect to the commercialisation potential o f their work. Finally, they will be entitled to carry forward outstanding Personal Financial Rewards balances in their Outside Funds accounts, in accordance with the School’s Research Allowances procedure. Emeritus staff cannot receive new PFRs, however. Note that research grant arrangements may have significant implications for the employment, tax and/or pension status of Emeritus Professors. These will need to be carefully managed, with advice from the HR Division, before any funding bids are made. Teaching and Other Roles Where appropriate, Emeritus Professors may teach courses, continue to supervise research students, and/or or contribute to other departmental work with the agreement of the Head of Department. Departments may appoint Emeritus Profe ssors on fractional, part- time Guest Teacher contracts in order to facilitate this. With the agreement of the Pro Directors, they may also take on specific School -level roles. Note that post -retirement arrangements of these kinds may have significant i mplications for the employment, tax and/or pension status of Emeritus Professors. These will need to be carefully managed, with advice from the HR Division, before arrangements are confirmed. Data and Technology Support Active Emeritus Professors will retain their LSE email address and ongoing access to the standard School software provision – which currently includes Office 365 tools such as Teams, Word, Excel, etc. They are entitled to the technical support services provided to all LSE staff and st udents and to internal DTS web content, which includes help articles on a wide range of technology matters. Note that some access, e.g., to departmental shared folders or specialist software, may be restricted because of licensing, data protection and ot her considerations. Library Membership and Support Active Emeritus Professors retain full LSE Library membership and retain all staff privileges, including borrowing and access to electronic resources. They are entitled to support from Library staff either in person or by email on 3 library.enquiries@lse.ac.uk. If more comprehensive support is required, they can contact a Departmental Librarian in the first instance for more advice. Librarians can provide specialist advice and support on finding and using resources through LSE Library and beyond. They can also provide support and advice on academic publishing. Use of Space Emeritus Professors are required to give up their offices upon retirement and do not have an automatic entitlement to office space. However, it is recognised that in the course of their ongoing activities at LSE they may require the use of shared desks, of fices, meeting rooms and/or storage facilities. In the first instance, space needs should be discussed with their home Department, Centre or Institute. In the context of the School’s blended working programme, it may also be possible for the School to provide shared space on a discretionary basis to Emeritus Professors where departmental provision is not available. Philanthropy and Global Engagement (PAGE) Emeritus Professors will be given access to the Alumni Centre and its facilities. They will receive information about Events in the School and be encouraged to continue to attend and participate in these. Where appropriate, they may be asked to participate in PAGE activities – for example, events for, and exchanges with, Alumni in different set tings. Staff Common Room and Staff Dining Room Emeritus Professors continue to have full access to the facilities of the Staff Common Room and the Staff Dining Room in the Old Building and are very welcome to participate in SCR and SDR events. Other Employee Benefits On a discretionary basis, and subject to contractual agreements with external suppliers, Emeritus Professors will retain access to elements of the School’s wellbeing provision, our training and development provision, and our hardship sup port provision. This currently includes access to the ‘LSE Extras’ wellbeing platform; the core events of our staff training and development programmes (with limited exceptions); free eye tests; our Employee Assistance Programme (which provides counsellin g, health advice, and other services); and our Financial Hardship Fund. Policies When undertaking any association with the School, Emeritus Professors must continue to abide by the 4 School’s policies and procedures, in particular the Ethics Code and our policies on Discrimination, Bullying and Harassment (including Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence), Data Protection, Free Speech, and Bribery and Fraud. The relevant policies and procedures can be found in the School’s Policy and Procedures database. Behaviour that breaches LSE policies will not be tolerated and may lead to Emeritus status being revoked. A committee comprising the four academic Pro Directors and the Vice Chair of the Appointments Committee may revoke Emerit us status when necessary. Process 1) On receipt of the written notice of retirement, the Head of Department or Departmental Manager should complete the Leaver and Internal Mover Form, indicating that the individual should become an Emeritus Professor upon retirement and forward this to Human Resources. 2) Human Resources will check whether the individual is eligible for Emeritus status and, if so, write to the Emeritus Professor to confirm the retirement and conferment. 3) A personal letter under the Director’s signature will also be sent to the Emeritus Professor. 4) Human Resources will inform Data and Technology Services (DTS) and the Central Badging Office so that the Emeritus Professor continues to have access to buildings, such as the LSE Library, and to their email and IT account. 5) On an a nnual basis, all Emeritus Professors will be required to ‘opt in’ to active Emeritus status so that they retain access to the full range of benefits.

       "  'text': '1 Introduction The School is committed to rewarding a ll emp loyees in a fair, equitable and co nsistent manner for the work that they are required to unde rtake by the School. HER A (the Higher Education Role Anal ysis methodology) provides an o bjective job ev aluation frame work within which e quitable dec isions can be made regarding the grading of roles; HER A therefore he lps to support the School in its commitment to equal pay for work of equal value, as enca psulated in the Equality Act 2010. HER A is the principal job evaluation framework specifically designed for the UK higher educ ation sector, covering professional se rvices, research and teaching roles. Policy Aims This policy covers circumstances where a job role has changed or is required to ch ange significantly and the line manager and p ost’s incumbent, both bel ieve that this may have affected the appro priate grad ing of the role. Where re-grade requests are made, it is important that these are dea lt with in a fair, transp arent and consistent manner. This policy sets out the key principles that will guide a ll re-grade requests, from the considerations required before submitting a cas e, to the way in which requests will be a pproa ched. Professional Services Grading Policy Operational 2 Policy Principles Job not jobholder Job e valuation is used to assess the requirements of a role and not the individual contribution of an employee. It is recognised that, over time, an individual’s particular skills set and contribution can organically change the shape a nd nature of a role and m ay legitimately lead to a reconsideration of the grade of the role. However, managers should think carefully about whether there is an ongoing need for a revised role in t he team structure, that contributes towards the strategic objectives of the d ivision or department, or whether it is actually a case where an individual’s contribution should be recognised via another means (e.g. contribution pay, an ad ditional responsibility allowance e tc.). HER A re-grades are not normally an appropri ate mechanism through which to respond to an urgent retention issue. Furthermore, sometim es emp loyees, with their active conse nt, are given a dditional d uties or responsibilities pu rely as a development opportunity. It can s ubsequently be d ifficult to recognise the tipping point of when a development opportunity becomes an o ngoing feature of a job, but this is something managers should be mindful of. Managers and employees are also enco uraged to monitor the continuous nature of any explicit developmental opportunities through the Career Development Review process and may want to give this particular attention o nce a development opportunity has continued be yond a year. HR Partners are available for support to help tease out and resolve these difficult issues. Substantial and permanent change Not all changes to a role will lead to re-grad e. To warrant consideration for a re- grade, changes should be subs tantial, permanent and op erationally necess ary. This would be a change of responsibility level, the a ddition of further skills or expertise, or an e ntirely new aspect to the role that involves a differe nt set of skills (e.g. line manageme nt being adde d to a role that previously had non e) and not previously counted in the HER A assessme nt. HER A does not measure changes in volume or demand, so ‘more of the same’ will not impact upon a HERA sc ore. Staff and managers should be aware that, even where a HER A score changes, this does not necess arily mean that the score will cross a po ints boundary into the next grade. Each salary band covers a range of scores and a job can simply move from b eing low to high scori ng within a single ban d. Converse ly, a role that is already close to a band boundary may be re-graded with relative little cha nge. It is therefore entirely possible that a similar type of change can affect two different roles to a differe nt degree. No one particular task guarantees a particular grade. Similarly, jobs that may look the same on the surface may be quite different in ways that are not always imme diately obvious. Sometimes it may be o ne quite specific task or responsibility that distinguishes between two roles in d ifferent grades that are othe rwise reasonably similar. Staff are therefore encouraged to exercise caution when co mparing roles across dep artments and should not assume that they are identical. Clear, well -evidenced cases It is acknowledged that it can take time to put together docume nts for a HERA evaluation, 3 but time spent thinking abo ut what is really required for a role – and how t o plainly express it in writing – will pay dividends in terms of both a smooth HER A process and the final usability of a job description that frames the work of one or m ore emp loyees. Job d escriptions shou ld not be written with the express i ntent of ‘satisfying’ HERA. They should be a clear statement of intent about what a job will actua lly entail. For examp le, stating that a role involves “com municating c omplex information to a range of audiences” is far less helpful to an employee than saying “providing regular verbal a nd written legal updates to both DMT and staff within the division”. Managers are strongly encouraged to seek early support from HR Partners and/or Advisers when drafting ne w or significantly changed job descriptions. Line managers are also required to submit a Role Review Form that outlines how a role has changed a nd how the d eveloped role fits into the wider team structure. This information is requested to demonstrate that the new requirements have a co nsidered p lace within the overall operation of the team, department or division. Furthermore, in the School’s com mitment to the principle of equal pay, it is important that managers take a step ba ck and consider the impact any individual grading d ecision may have on the wider team and/or School context, e.g. where a number of roles were previously the same grade, or the same role is held by a number of people, the manager should be confident that raising the grade of one post or individual only can be l egitimately justified a nd that it is the role and n ot the individual that is being re-grade d. More guidance on the HERA compe tencies can be found here (link). Staff and managers are encouraged to focus on the competency areas that are relevant to the role and to demonstrate the way in which the d emands of the role have de veloped. Examp les given as illust rations shou ld be representative of the normal demands of the role (which can include infrequent but recurrent events), rather than rare or exceptional c ircum stances that are not expected to be repeated. Decisions by panel Panels will be comp rised of members of the HR Division a nd managers across the School, all of whom will be e xterna lly trained in the use of HERA. This recognizes that responsibility for maintaining integrity in the School’s grad ing structure is a School-wide d uty, not one that rests solely with HR. Re-grade ap plications will be su bmitted to the HER A panel without the n ame of the individual in order to anonymise the a pplicati on. However, it is not practical to ensure that all panel memb ers are ignorant of the name of a particular job h older, although it will be incumbent upon p anel members to identify any poten tial co nflicts of interest. The role of the pa nel is not to scrutinise the job description an d/or business case, but to cons ider all cas es in good faith and to make job evaluation d ecisions based on the evidence in front of them. Where the panel feels that there is a significant issue with the paperwork that makes it difficult to come to a final decision (e.g. two roles are put forward with seem ingly overlapping areas of responsibility), the p anel may put the evaluation on h old and r efer questions back to manager. Where a role is reviewed and the grade rema ins unchanged, constructive written feedback will be pro vided by the pa nel and the employee and manager will have the opportunity to revise and r esubmit the job description and role review form a second time. A n ewly formed HER A panel will undertake the sec ond review, and the dec ision of 4 this second panel will be final, with no further submission p ossible for another 12 months. Ongoing review Should roles that have been re-graded subsequently become vacant, managers should review the job d escription before re-recruiting to the role in o rder to identify whether the drivers for the higher grade a re still in place. Particularly where a role has grown gradually over time, it may well be t hat the actual future requirements of the role are lesser than before. Managers should not fall into the trap of assumi ng that a h igher grade is always best, as it is important that new emp loyees are recru ited to roles where their expectations of the role and t he actual demands when in post are a clear match, as well as be ing appropriate to their skill level. Annual monitoring The Human Resources Division will report trend data annually to the Jo int Negotiation, Information and C onsultation Committee (JNICC), including relevant Equality and D iversity monitoring measure s.
